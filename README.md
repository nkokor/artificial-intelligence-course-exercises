# artificial-intelligence-course-exercises
This repository contains exercises that I have done as part of the "Artificial Intelligence" course at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo. 

The exercises demonstrate the use of some of the basic machine learning Python libraries such as Keras, Tensorflow, pandas and scikit-learn through examples.


Problems are organized in such a way that each problem is located in a separate folder. Within some of these folders there are also data folders containing all the necessary external files.

All code is accompanied by comments describing what each code section does.

# Setup

Download the project and open the folder containing the code you're interested in, then run the .py file in that specific folder. 

If you are running the code in an IDE such as Visual Studio Code, keep in mind that some package installations might be necessary.
You can install the used packages by opening the terminal and running the following commands:

```
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
pip install skikit-learn
pip install matplotlib
```

If you run into problems by running these commands, try using the following alternatives:

```
pip install numpy --user
pip install pandas --user
pip install tensorflow --user
pip install keras --user
pip install skikit-learn --user
pip install matplotlib --user
```
